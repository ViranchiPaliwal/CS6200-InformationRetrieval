marine current power wikipedia marine current power from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search marine current power is a form of marine energy obtained from harnessing of the kinetic energy of marine currents such as the gulf stream although not widely used at present marine current power has an important potential for future electricity generation marine currents are more predictable than wind and solar power 1 a 2006 report from united states department of the interior estimates that capturing just 1 1,000th of the available energy from the gulf stream would supply florida with 35 of its electrical needs 2 strong ocean currents are generated from a combination of temperature wind salinity bathymetry and the rotation of the earth the sun acts as the primary driving force causing winds and temperature differences because there are only small fluctuations in current speed and stream location with minimal changes in direction ocean currents may be suitable locations for deploying energy extraction devices such as turbines 3 other effects such as regional differences in temperature and salinity and the coriolis effect due to the rotation of the earth are also major inﬂuences the kinetic energy of marine currents can be converted in much the same way that a wind turbine extracts energy from the wind using various types of open-ﬂow rotors 4 the potential of electric power generation from marine tidal currents is enormous there are several factors that make electricity generation from marine currents very appealing when compared to other renewables the high load factors resulting from the ﬂuid properties the predictability of the resource so that unlike most of other renewables the future availability of energy can be known and planned for 4 the potentially large resource that can be exploited with little environmental impact thereby offering one of the least damaging methods for large-scale electricity generation 5 the feasibility of marine-current power installations to provide also base grid power especially if two or more separate arrays with offset peak-ﬂow periods are interconnected
