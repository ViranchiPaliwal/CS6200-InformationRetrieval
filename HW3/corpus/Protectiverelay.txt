protective relay wikipedia protective relay from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search see also power system protection electromechanical protective relays at a hydroelectric generating plant the relays are in round glass cases the rectangular devices are test connection blocks used for testing and isolation of instrument transformer circuits in electrical engineering a protective relay is a relay device designed to trip a circuit breaker when a fault is detected 1 4 the first protective relays were electromagnetic devices relying on coils operating on moving parts to provide detection of abnormal operating conditions such as over-current over-voltage reverse power flow over-frequency and under-frequency 2 microprocessor-based digital protection relays now emulate the original devices as well as providing types of protection and supervision impractical with electromechanical relays electromechanical relays provide only rudimentary indications of involved phase and zone targets 3 in many cases a single microprocessor relay provides functions that would take two or more electromechanical devices by combining several functions in one case numerical relays also save capital cost and maintenance cost over electromechanical relays 4 however due to their very long life span tens of thousands of these silent sentinels 5 are still protecting transmission lines and electrical apparatus all over the world important transmission lines and generators have cubicles dedicated to protection with many individual electromechanical devices or one or two microprocessor relays the theory and application of these protective devices is an important part of the education of a power engineer who specializes in power systems the need to act quickly to protect circuits and equipment as well as the general public often requires protective relays to respond and trip a breaker within a few thousandths of a second in some instances these clearance times are prescribed in legislation or operating rules 6 a maintenance or testing program is used to determine the performance and availability of protection systems 7 based on the end application and applicable legislature various standards such as ansi c37.90 iec255-4 iec60255-3 and iac govern the response time of the relay to the fault conditions that may occur 8
