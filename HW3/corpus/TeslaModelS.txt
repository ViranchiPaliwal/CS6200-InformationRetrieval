2017 update the following versions are available 60 60d 75 75d 90d and p100d owners of the earlier 70 and 70d model s have the option to unlock the 75 kwh capacity via a software update adding up to 19 miles 31 km per charge 16 the 60 and 60d model s reintroduced in june 2016 have a us 9,000 option to unlock the full 75 kwh capacity via a software update any time after purchase 17 in august 2016 tesla introduced the p100d as the new top-level model the p100d model has a 100 kwh battery a 0–60 mph 0–97 km h time of 2.28 seconds and over 300 miles 485 km of epa rated range 18 the model s became the first electric car to top the monthly new car sales ranking in any country twice leading in norway in september and december 2013 19 20 21 22 and also in denmark in december 2015 23 global model s sales passed the 150,000 unit milestone in november 2016 with the u.s as the leading market with 57 of global sales 24 other leading country markets are norway china hong kong the netherlands canada denmark germany and switzerland 25 26 the tesla model s has ranked as the world s best-selling plug-in electric car for two years in a row 2015 and 2016 26 27 the model s also ranked as the top selling plug-in electric car in the u.s for two years running 2015 and 2016 28 as of december 2016 update the model s is the world s second best selling plug-in electric car in history after the nissan leaf 29 the tesla model s won awards including the 2013 world green car of the year 2013 motor trend car of the year automobile magazine s 2013 car of the year time magazine best 25 inventions of the year 2012 award and consumer reports top-scoring car in its road testing in 2015 car and driver named the model s the car of the century 30 after declining to recommend the model s in 2015 due to reliability issues one year later consumer reports added the car to the magazine s recommended list 31 32 history edit tesla model s prototype at the 2009 frankfurt motor show the model s was styled by franz von holzhausen who previously worked for mazda north american operations 33 the car was codenamed whitestar during research and preliminary development 1 2 3 it was officially announced in a press release on june 30 2008 34 35 the prototype vehicle was displayed at a press conference on march 26 2009 36 in february 2008 it was reported that tesla inc then tesla motors was planning to offer a range-extended version of its model s this version would have included a gasoline engine to extend the driving range of the vehicle 37 but it was removed in later revisions at the goinggreen conference in september 2008 tesla s ceo elon musk announced that tesla was developing only electric cars 38 construction of an assembly factory in albuquerque new mexico a central location for shipping was supposed to begin in april 2007 but was cancelled 39 a factory to be built in san jose california was also announced 40 41 42 in may 2010 tesla announced it would produce the model s at the former nummi assembly plant in fremont california 43 now known as the tesla factory this third plan was implemented the first production tesla model s with owner tesla board member steve jurvetson in june 2015 three years after the car s market release in june 2015 three years after the model s introduction and with almost 75,000 model s sedans delivered worldwide tesla announced that model s owners have accumulated over 1 billion electric miles 1.6 billion km traveled and saved more than half a million tons of co 2 44 45 the tesla model s is the first plug-in electric vehicle to reach that milestone in october 2014 general motors reported that volt owners had accumulated a total of 629 million all-electric miles over 1 billion kilometers out of a total of 1 billion miles 1.6 billion km traveled while nissan reported in december 2014 that leaf owners had traveled 625 million miles 1 billion kilometers 45 tesla also reported that 68 of model s travel took place in north america 25 in europe and 7 in asia-pacific 45 global model s sales passed the 100,000 unit milestone in december 2015 46 and the 150,000 mark in november 2016 24 in 2016 a racing series called the electric gt world series was promoted in preparation for a 2017 racing season using the p85 as a race car on certain traditional tracks the first season is planned to have 20 cars in 10 teams 47 facelift tesla model s in april 2016 a refreshed model s was introduced the front fascia has a similar design as the model x and also adaptive led headlights were introduced also the improved model s has a hepa air filtration system that removes at least 99.97 of particulate exhaust pollution and all allergens bacteria and other contaminants from cabin air the standard charger was upgraded from 40 to 48 amps in order to enable faster charging when connected to higher-amp outlets two new interior choices were added figured ash wood and dark ash wood these improvements were accompanied by a us 1,500 price increase in the base model 48 production edit main article tesla factory § tesla model s manufacturing process a tesla model s being manufactured at the tesla factory tesla manufactures the model s at the 5.4 million square foot 49 tesla factory in fremont california for the european market tesla assembles and distributes from its european distribution center in tilburg the netherlands 50 cars are built and tested in fremont california the battery pack the electric motor and parts are disassembled and shipped separately to tilburg where the cars are reassembled 51 the center occupies a 203,000 sq ft 18,900 m 2 industrial building that also serves as a workshop and spare parts warehouse tesla expects the model s to pay back the energy that went into producing the car in fewer than 10,000 miles 16,000 km 52 the first ten customers received their cars at the fremont factory on june 22 2012 at the official launch 53 production grew from 15–20 cars completed week in august 2012 53 to about 1,000 cars per week in 2015 54 in october 2015 tesla announced the company is negotiating with the chinese government on producing its electric cars domestically local production has the potential to reduce the sales prices of tesla models by a third 55 a model s starts at us 71,500 in the u.s. while in china pricing starts at cn¥673,000 about us 106,000 after duties and other taxes 56 elon musk clarified that production will remain in the u.s. but if there s sufficient local demand for the tesla model 3 in china a factory could be built in the country as soon as a year after the launch of the new model production in europe will also depend on the region s demand for the model 3 57 design edit model s chassis on display at santana row in san jose california the model s exists in several versions differing in energy capacity battery size power motor size and equipment it is classified as a fullsize luxury car in the usa or as a large car 58 120 cu ft or more or luxury sedan 59 by the epa the euro car segment classification is s-segment sports car 60 61 or oberklasse in germany 62 powertrain edit a tesla model s p85 using regenerative braking power in excess of 60 kw during regenerative braking the power indicator is green the 2012 tesla model s performance model has a three phase four pole ac induction 416 hp 310 kw and 443 ft·lb 600 n·m rear-mounted electric motor with copper rotor 63 the base model uses a 362 hp 270 kw and 325 ft·lb 440 n·m motor the company claimed a drag coefficient of c d 0.24 64 lower than any car when released 65 independent measurement by car and driver in may 2014 bore out tesla s claim by exactly confirming a drag coefficient of c d 0.24 66 the rear axle has a traditional open differential models with dual motors also have an open differential on the front axles as well the front and rear axles have no mechanical linkage – with dual motors the power distribution among them is controlled electronically 67 the model s p90d has a top speed of 155 mph 249 km h and it accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour 0 to 97 km h in 2.8 seconds despite the lower total motor power in part due to the improved traction of the all-wheel drive powertrain the model s p85d a dual motor all-wheel drive vehicle has a governed top speed of 155 mph 249 km h 68 and it accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour 0 to 97 km h in 3.2 seconds tested to 3.1 seconds under insane mode with 1 g of acceleration 68 69 new p85ds have an optional ludicrous mode hardware package available with the 90 kwh battery upgrade thus becoming a p90d that improves the 0 to 60 miles per hour 0 to 97 km h acceleration to 2.8 seconds and 1.1g 70 71 72 tesla initially reported the total output in the p85d as the arithmetic addition of the maximum power of the individual electric motors at 691 hp 515 kw but later reported it as 463 hp 345 kw because the two motors do not give their maximum power at the same time 73 the powertrain also provides regenerative braking power of more than 60 kw which reduces both energy consumption and improves brake lifetime owners reported many powertrain issues from 2012 improving significantly over the years 74 in july 2015 tesla announced its goal to make the model s powertrain last for one million miles 75 dual-motor all-wheel-drive versions edit on october 9 2014 tesla announced the introduction of all wheel drive awd versions of the model s s 60 85 and p85 models designated by a d at the end of the model number 76 77 78 on april 8 2015 tesla introduced the model s 70d as its new us 75,000 entry-level car with all-wheel drive and an improved range of 240 miles 385 km the 70d replaced the 60 and 60d in the model s lineup with the latter two models no longer being available for purchase the p85 option was also dropped 79 80 in the 85d the rear drive unit is replaced by a smaller one to save cost and weight while a second motor of similar size is added to the front wheels this results in an awd car with comparable power and acceleration to the rwd version while keeping the price increase to us 5,000 additionally the 85d reports a 2 5-mile range increase and 11 increase in top speed over the 85 81 because awd from a motor on each axle does not have the inefficiencies of single engine awd systems in the p85d the high-power rear drive unit is retained while a new front drive motor boosts the total power by about 50 this results in a significant increase in acceleration and top speed the 85 kwh version rose from us 81,070 to us 86,070 while the p85 now the p85d jumped from us 94,570 to us 105,670 deliveries of the p85d started in december 2014 with the 85d models starting in february 2015 and the 70d models starting in april 2015 77 on june 9 2016 tesla reintroduced the 60 and 60d which has a 75 kwh battery locked out to 60 kwh 82 but upgradable by software as is the autopilot option the spring refresh of 2016 also offers the bioweapon defense mode airfilter first offered on the model x 83 on august 23 2016 tesla introduced the model s p100d with ludicrous mode as its new us 134,500 top-level car with all-wheel drive and an improved epa estimated range of 315 miles 505 km 18 this version of the model s is notable for being the first electric vehicle to have a u.s epa estimated range greater than 300 miles 485 km and for being the fastest accelerating vehicle currently in production with a 0–60 mph 0–97 km h time of 2.5 seconds when optioned with ludicrous mode 84 85 battery edit cylindrical cell 18650 prior to assembly several thousand of them form the tesla model s battery see gigafactory in 2012 the epa range for the 60 kwh battery pack model was 208 mi 335 km 86 and the 85 kwh battery was 265 miles 426 km 12 87 according to musk the model s has a battery with twice the energy density of that on the nissan leaf but the difference in range is more than double this is also due to other factors such as drag coefficient weight motor efficiency and rolling resistance 88 musk stated that driving at 65 mph 105 km h under normal conditions gives a reasonable range of 250 miles 400 km 89 the energy-saving sleep state powers off the display and other vehicle electronics after the car goes to sleep this increases the time it takes the touchscreen and instrument panel to become usable this mode can decrease the loss of the car s range when not being used 2.3 mi 3.7 km per day as of 2013 update 90 the 85 kwh battery pack weighs 1,200 lb 540 kg 91 better source needed and contains 7,104 lithium-ion battery cells in 16 modules 92 wired in series 14 in the flat section and two stacked on the front 93 each module contains 6 groups 94 of 74 cells 95 wired in parallel the 6 groups are then wired in series within the module 95 96 97 98 as of june 2012 update the battery pack used modified panasonic cells with nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathodes 4 each cell was of the 18650 form factor i.e. an 18 mm diameter 65 mm height cylinder similar to the panasonic ncr18650b cell that has an energy density of 265 wh kg 99 analysts estimate battery cost to be around 21–22 of the car cost 100 list price for a replacement battery was us 44,000 in february 2015 101 the battery is guaranteed for eight years or 125,000 miles 200,000 km in metric countries for the base model with the 60 kwh battery pack the 85 kwh battery pack is guaranteed for eight years and unlimited miles 102 103 a poll among drivers indicate that accumulated battery loss steadies around 5 after 30,000 miles 50,000 km 74 104 decreasing further about 1 per additional 30,000 miles unlike nissan tesla does not specify a limit for battery loss but some early battery packs have been replaced 101 105 a separate battery replacement guarantee takes effect after the eighth year at a cost of us 10,000 for the 60 kwh battery and us 12,000 for the 85 kwh battery 106 in 2013 tesla canceled a 40 kwh version of the car due to lack of demand stating that only 4 of pre-orders were for the 40 kwh battery option customers who ordered this option instead received the 60 kwh pack with charge software-limited to 40 kwh 139 miles 224 km 107 it has the improved acceleration and top speed of the bigger pack and can be upgraded to use the full 60 kwh for us 11,000 108 on april 8 2015 tesla discontinued the model s 60 and replaced the base model with the model s 70 109 in 2015 tesla introduced a 70 kwh battery to replace the existing 60 kwh batteries and base 60 kwh model s vehicles as the 60 was low margin and not sufficiently welcomed by customers 110 111 all 70 kwh cars can be had with rear-wheel drive or all wheel drive 112 the 60 was re-introduced in 2016 as a software-limited 75 upgradable to 75 in july 2015 tesla introduced its 70 90 90d and p90d variants along with a ludicrous mode for the performance model the p90d combines a front axle power of 259 horsepower 193 kw and rear axle power of 503 horsepower 375 kw to a total of 762 horsepower 568 kw for a 0–60 mph time of 2.8 sec the acceleration of the p90d can reach 1.1 g described by tesla as faster than falling 75 the ludicrous mode costs us 10,000 for p90d but was discounted to us 5,000 plus labor for p85d owners until january 2016 113 tesla model s showing the front trunk where the engine would be in a typical car tesla calls this a frunk 114 tesla described its july 2015 introduction of the 90 kwh battery as a range upgrade of the 85 kwh battery and explained that the 6 energy increase was due to improved cell chemistry 75 and the introduction of silicon into the cell s graphite anode 115 tesla additionally announced its expectation of an annual improvement in battery capacity of about 5 tesla also explained that apart from the p90d the model s has its main battery conductor protected by a fuse rated for 1,300 a and that this rating is somewhat conservative given the uncertainty of the exact conditions under which a fuse melts to reduce this uncertainty tesla has for the p90d introduced inconel battery contactors 116 and an electronically controlled pyro-activated fuse which monitors the current at the millisecond level cuts the power with extreme precision and certainty and has a rating of 1,500 a 75 in february 2016 the 85 kwh battery option was discontinued in countries including the us australia and canada 117 in march 2016 media reported that a firmware version distributed for the tesla model s had support for a p100d variant that was yet to come 118 this battery is more complicated to make than the 90 version 119 the p100d was released in august 2016 18 practicality and livability edit the model s is notable for being designed solely with an electric powertrain in mind unlike other vehicles where the manufacturer has simply swapped out or supplanted an internal combustion engine with an electric motor 120 as a result the model s is able to offer unique features such as a front trunk frunk in addition to a spacious rear trunk with a capacity of 894 liters and a greatly enlarged front crumple zone compared to the typical combustion engine powered vehicle 84 to enhance livability tesla has developed a network of fast-charging supercharger stations that allow the driver to quickly and easily top-up the charge on their model s 84 this supercharger network has rapidly expanded in europe across the united states and other countries where there is significant demand and as of september 2016 update the network has been established in most american states thus making cross-country and long distance trips in an electric vehicle feasible and greatly alleviating fears of range anxiety 84 see the supercharger section below for further information researchers from the university of california davis conducted a study to identify the factors influencing the decision to adopt high-end battery electric vehicles bev such as the tesla model s as these vehicles are remarkably different from mainstream bevs the 2016 study found that environmental performance and technological motivations are reasons for adoption the new technology brings a new segment of buyers into the market and financial purchase incentives are not important in the consumer’s decision to adopt a high-end bev 121 specifications edit model s features past and current 40 kwh a 60 kwh 70 kwh 75 kwh 85 kwh 90 kwh 100 kwh rwd rwd 60

33.7 kwh battery placement edit in contrast to most other battery electric vehicles including the roadster the battery pack of the model s forms the floor of the vehicle between the axles providing the vehicle with several advantages most notably since the battery pack is the single heaviest component of the vehicle the model s has a center of gravity height of only 18 inches 46 cm 91 132 about the same as a lotus elise 133 helping it to achieve a lateral acceleration of 0.9g 134 and good protection against rollover 135 136 secondly the absence of a heavy engine between the front or rear axle allows the bulk of the mass to be centralized between the axles lowering rotational inertia allowing it to turn more quickly for its weight thirdly the placement of the battery pack increases the rigidity of the passenger compartment improving the passive safety of the vehicle 137 fourth placing the battery pack under the vehicle makes it possible to remove or replace the entire unit in 90 seconds 138 either for maintenance or for tesla s battery swap service charger edit the model s charge port is located in front of the left taillight model s charging connectors at the tesla store in austin texas in all markets the charge port is located behind a door in the left taillight during charging the charge port pulses green the frequency at which the charge port s light pulses slows down as the charge level approaches full when charging is complete the light stops pulsing and is solid green 139 the model s comes equipped with a different charger and connector in north american versus other markets derived from differences in the local electric grid systems north america edit the standard north american onboard charger accepts single phase 120 or 240-volt sources at a rate of up to 10 kw included adapters allow the car to charge from a standard 120 volt outlet a 240 volt nema 14-50 outlet and sae j1772 public chargers an optional us 2,000 upgrade for a second 10 kw onboard charger supports a total of up to 20 kw charging from an 80 amp available us 750 tesla wall connector 4 the north american connector uses a proprietary tesla design charging times vary depending on the battery pack s state-of-charge its overall capacity the available voltage and the available circuit breaker amperage from a 120 volt 15 amp household outlet the range increases by 3.75 miles 6 km for every hour of charging from a 10 kw nema 14–50 240 v 50 a outlet like those used by rvs or standard cooking ranges the charge rate is 28.75 miles 46 km per hour using tesla s 20 kw 240 v high

standard european charger accepts three phase 230 v or 400 v at up to 11 kw the type 2 connector on the car directly accepts mennekes iec 62196 charging from public stations at up to 400 v and included adapters allow the car to charge from standard continental european outlets and iec 60309 230 volt blue 3-pin or 400 volt red 5-pin outlets depending on region the addition of a second charger supports charging at up to 22 kw providing up to 70 miles 110 km of range per hour of charge the tesla wall connector is expected to be available in the second quarter of 2016 141 type 2-compatible outlet found on tesla superchargers in europe suspension edit the model s has independent coil spring suspension on all four wheels – front double wishbone virtual steer axis control arm and rear independent multilink 63 as an extra-cost option the car is available with self-leveling height-adjustable air suspension this is accomplished via adjustable bilstein shock absorbers controlled by the driver the car is meant to lower itself at highway speed and raise itself to traverse steep driveways and rough terrain despite the low 6-inch ground clearance and rather long 116-inch wheelbase 142 because in the tesla electronic systems can be upgraded by over-the-air download rather than recall the suspension system has been changed retroactively on several occasions during the 2013 fire investigation nhtsa asked tesla to disable the car s ability to lower itself at speed on the theory that a ground clearance below 6 inches might cause the batteries underneath the car to contact road debris 143 in september 2014 tesla upgraded the height adjustment feature for model s cars equipped with air suspension to remember locations that require higher clearance such as those with potholes and steep driveways and automatically adjusts to avoid them 144 autopilot edit main article tesla autopilot see also autonomous car and connected car beginning in late september 2014 all new model s vehicles come equipped with a camera supplied by mobileye mounted at the top of the windshield forward looking radar supplied by bosch 145 146 in the lower grill and ultrasonic acoustic location sensors in the front and rear bumpers that provide a 360-degree buffer zone around the car this equipment allows model s to detect road signs lane markings obstacles and other vehicles in addition to adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning a us 2,500 tech package option will allow this system to enable semi-autonomous drive and parking capabilities 147 148 149 all model s sold since october 2014 have the option to have autopilot which allows limited hands-free driving autopilot-enabled cars receive software updates for the autopilot software wirelessly just as all other model s cars receive general software updates wirelessly according to elon musk the model s was designed to be a computer on wheels we really designed the model s to be a very sophisticated computer on wheels tesla is a software company as much as it is a hardware company a huge part of what tesla is is a silicon valley software company we view this the same as updating your phone or your laptop 150 full autonomy is “really a software limitation the hardware exists to create full autonomy so it’s really about developing advanced narrow ai for the car to operate on.“ 151 152 tesla s autonomous driving features are ahead of production cars and its autopilot can be classified as somewhere between levels 2 and 3 under the u.s department of transportation ’s national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa five levels of vehicle automation at this level the car can act autonomously but requires the full attention of the driver who must be prepared to take control at a moment s notice 153 154 155 autopilot is suitable only on limited-access highways and sometimes it will fail to detect lane markings and disengage itself in urban driving the system will not read traffic signals or obey stop signs the system also does not detect pedestrians or cyclists 156 starting october 2016 all tesla cars are built with the necessary hardware to allow full self-driving capability at a safety level sae level 5 157 the system will operate in shadow mode processing without taking action and send data back to tesla to improve its abilities until the software is ready for deployment via over-the-air upgrades 158 tesla says it expects to enable full self-driving by the end of 2017 after proper testing 157 fatal accident edit the first known fatal accident involving a tesla model s when the car was in autopilot mode took place in williston florida on 7 may 2016 the driver was killed in a crash with a large 18-wheel tractor-trailer by late june 2016 the u.s national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the florida highway patrol according to the nhtsa preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when the tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway and the car failed to apply the brakes the car continued to travel after passing under the truck’s trailer 159 160 161 the nhtsa s preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash which involves a population of an estimated 25,000 model s cars 162 on 8 july 2016 the nhtsa requested tesla motors to hand over to the agency detailed information about the design operation and testing of its autopilot technology the agency also requested details of all design changes and updates to autopilot since its introduction and tesla s planned updates scheduled for the next four months 163 according to tesla neither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky so the brake was not applied the car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the model s tesla also stated that this was tesla’s first known autopilot death in over 130 million miles 208 million km driven by its customers where autopilot was activated according to tesla there is a fatality every 94 million miles 150 million km among all type of vehicles in the u.s 159 160 164 some statisticians say that tesla s use of statistics is meaningless due to the relatively small total distance traveled by tesla cars and the different driving conditions of the two data sets being compared it is estimated that billions of miles will need to be traveled before a statistically significant comparison can be made researchers say that tesla and others need to release more data on the limitations and performance of automated driving systems if self-driving cars are to become safe and understood enough for mass market use 165 instrument panel edit production dashboard with main dashboard digital display left and central 17-inch 430 mm touchscreen control panel right the instrument panel is a 12.3-inch 31 cm liquid-crystal display electronic instrument cluster that indicates speed power usage charge level estimated range and active gear as well as nav directions driven by garmin the gearbox can be set to drive neutral reverse and park the infotainment control touchscreen is a 17-inch 43 cm multi-touch panel divided into four areas a top line displays status symbols and provides shortcuts to charging homelink driver profiles vehicle information software version and the vehicle identification number and bluetooth the second line provides access to several apps including media nav driven by google maps and thus is separate from the nav on instrument panel energy web camera and phone the central main viewing area displays the two active apps subdivided into upper and lower areas most apps can be expanded to take up the entire area at the bottom is access to various controls and settings for the vehicle such as doors locks and lights as well as temperature controls and a secondary volume control the instrument cluster and the infotainment panel are driven by separate nvidia tegra 3 3d visual computing modules 166 167 tesla was the first company to ship this technology audi later delivered this technology in its 2013 model year in europe and in north america in 2014 168 the tegra system on a chip soc integrates eight specialized processors including a multi-core arm cpu a gpu and dedicated audio video and image processors nvidia claimed that it consumes 2 of the energy of a typical cpu 169 the navigation system uses gps and a mix of garmin and google maps route guidance the map display on the 17-inch screen requires a constant internet connection so navigation is limited in areas without mobile network coverage the nav on the instrument panel is loaded on the car and does not need internet access to function 170 update 6.2 features automatic nav guidance to charging stations if range is insufficient 171 enthusiasts have developed the open vehicle monitoring system ovms which allows the owner to remotely observe a variety of different vehicle operating parameters such as battery state of charge typically using a smartphone some switchgear used are mercedes parts such as window switches cruise control lever and drive selector according to elon musk the model s runs on the open-source linux operating system 172 in 2014 autoblog reported that tesla models s owners had determined via the car s combined diagnostics and ethernet port that a ubuntu system controlling the central touchscreen is connected to the car s internal ethernet 173 the same users determined that another ubuntu system controlling the dashboard navigation screen also is connected to the internal network together with a third computer of unknown type with an unknown function 174 features edit the model s has an optional folding third row with rear-facing seats for two children secured with a racing-style five-point harness the model s key all versions of the model s have the same body and normally seat five passengers an optional folding third row for us 2,500 becomes a rear-facing two-place child seat the option includes a stronger rear bumper 132 136 each third row seat has a racing-style five-point harness for passengers over 37 in 0.94 m tall and weighing between 35 to 77 lb 16 to 35 kg cargo space is available under the front hood which tesla called a frunk a portmanteau of front trunk the optional third row gives the greatest passenger capacity of any electric vehicle 175 in october 2014 the upgraded model s p85d d for dual was introduced 176 the upgraded version features two electric motors one driving the rear wheels as in prior versions and one driving the front wheels safety features are enhanced also for example with partial auto-pilot functions the dual motor version will be available also for the basic 85 kwh versions for around us 4,000 more in price the rear wheel drive version of the p85 was removed and the dual motor option is not available for the 60 kwh version 79 the 2015 model year update introduced electromechanical brakes 177 in 2016 the 85 kwh and later 90 kwh battery was discontinued from all markets a glass roof with no horizontal roof bar between the b-pillars was introduced in late 2016 178 vehicle warranty and maintenance edit the model s is covered by a 4-year 50,000 mi 80,000 km limited warranty 179 that includes all standard equipment the transmission and the complete powertrain excluding tires 180 the warranty can be extended an additional 4 years or 50,000 miles 80,000 km beyond the original terms for us 4,000 180 warranty coverage includes a complementary loaner car—a performance 85 or tesla roadster—when service is required 181 in april 2013 tesla announced that a previously mandatory us 600 annual vehicle inspection and maintenance fee would be made optional and would not be required to maintain warranty coverage 181 if chosen the fee covers a complete inspection tire alignment new brake pads hardware upgrades and miscellaneous other maintenance items as needed the battery and drive unit are covered for eight years or 125,000 miles 200,000 km in metric countries for the 60 kwh base model or eight years and unlimited distance for all 70 and 85 kwh models 102 182 the unconditional battery warranty covers everything except deliberate damage even including user error 183 however loss of battery capacity over time or usage is not covered under warranty clarification needed 182 184 environmental footprint edit in february 2014 the automotive science group asg published the result of a study conducted to assess the life-cycle of over 1,300 automobiles across nine categories sold in north america the study ranked the model s as the best environmental performer in the 2014 full-size cars category 185 based on the assessment of life-cycle environmental footprint the study concluded that the increased environmental impacts of manufacturing the vehicle are more than offset with increased environmental performance during operation for the assessment the study used the average electricity mix of the u.s grid in 2014 the nissan leaf had the smallest life-cycle environmental footprint of any model year 2014 automobile available in the north american market 186 in 2015 the union of concerned scientists found that in the us regions where the model s is popular the 68 higher manufacturing emissions are offset within a few years of average driving during their life-cycle evs emit about half the amount of comparable fossil cars 187 188 according to an ibm researcher this analysis is the best available 189 tesla has worked with toxco kinsbursky in the us since 2008 and umicore in europe 190 to recycle worn out rohs batteries 191 192 which will be performed in gigafactory 1 193 tesla stations edit tesla model s charging at the supercharger network station in newark delaware united states tesla model s charging at a public charging station in zoutelande the netherlands main article tesla station in 2012 tesla began building a network of 480-volt charging stations to facilitate long-distance travel in june 2013 tesla announced that existing and future stations would become tesla stations with facilities to support under-two-minute battery pack swaps as of early october 2014 115 stations were operating in the united states 71 in europe and 23 in asia 194 195 the tesla network is usable only by tesla vehicles which are engineered for compatibility the first supercharger corridor opened in october 2012 with six stations placed along routes connecting san francisco lake tahoe los angeles and las vegas 196 197 a second corridor opened in december 2012 connecting washington d.c. new york city and boston it includes three stations located in highway rest areas in delaware and connecticut 198 the first tesla stations in europe opened in norway in august 2013 199 tesla next focused on germany and the netherlands with plans to cover both countries by mid-2014 switzerland belgium austria denmark and luxembourg were to be covered by the end of 2014 stations were to be within 200 mi 320 km for about 90 of the population in france england wales and sweden by the end of 2014 200 supercharger edit the supercharger is a proprietary dc rapid-charging station that provides up to 135 kw of power giving 85 kwh vehicles an additional 180 mi 290 km of range in about 15–30 minutes older 60 kwh may have reduced charge rate 201 in the west coast corridor the superchargers s grid access is assisted by a solar carport system some including a battery of a few hundred kwh 202 provided by solarcity eventually all tesla stations will be assisted by solar power supercharging hardware is now a standard on all vehicles sold by tesla the roadster is not compatible 196 197 198 in early november 2013 tesla reported that 90 of its customers had opted for supercharging capability 200 as of april 2016 update there are over 620 open superchargers around the world elon musk said at the unveiling of the model 3 that that number would be doubled by the end of 2017 tesla has received criticism about the length of time it has taken them to install chargers on high use corridors of the united states such as i-40 and i-80 citation needed tesla built 120 kw 203 tesla supercharger stations to allow long distance travel in north america europe asia and australia 204 a supercharger can add up to 125 miles 201 km of range in 20 minutes and a full charge in approximately one hour assuming a nearly empty 85 kwh battery 4 140 supercharging hardware is included in the 85 kwh 70 kwh and 60 kwh battery packs in both the 85 kwh models and 70 kwh models 205 the payment for the car includes supercharging by default but in the 60 kwh supercharging was software-disabled and one must pay an extra fee to enable supercharging 102 140 206 207 battery swapping edit tesla designed its model s to allow fast battery swapping which also facilitates vehicle assembly 208 in june 2013 tesla announced their goal to deploy a battery swapping station in tesla stations at a demonstration tesla showed a battery swap operation taking just over 90 seconds about half the time it takes to refill an empty gas tank 209 210 panoramic view of tesla supercharger rapid charging station in tejon ranch california battery swapping was to be deployed along interstate 5 in california to allow travel from san francisco to los angeles these were to be followed by the washington d.c to boston corridor each swapping station costs us 500,000 and stocks about 50 batteries the service would be offered for the price of about 15 us gallons 57 l 12 imp gal of gasoline at the current local rate around us 60 to us 80 at june 2013 prices owners can pick up their original battery pack fully charged on the return trip which is included in the swap fee tesla would also offer the option to keep the swapped battery for a fee or to receive the original pack from tesla for a fee pricing has not been determined 209 tesla s only battery swap station is located at harris ranch near selma california and was available for pilot testing in late december 2014 211 as of 2015 update tesla says they have hundreds of cars in the battery swap program although few owners are interested in using the service 212 in june 2015 tesla said that it was unlikely that more battery swap stations would be added due to lack of demand for battery swaps costing around 60 when supercharging is included free with most models 213 editions edit tesla allocated the first 1,000 units to its signature and signature performance limited edition configurations equipped with the 85 kwh battery pack and priced in the u.s at us 95,400 and us 105,400 respectively not including any applicable u.s federal and local government tax credits and incentives 214 215 as of july 2015 update the base model s starts at us 75,000 with a 70 kwh battery pack and goes up to us 105,000 for the performance model with the 85 kwh

global edit model s first retail deliveries ceremony at the tesla factory in fremont california held on june 22 2012 tesla reported 520 reservations for the model s during the first week they were available 218 and by december 2012 a total 15,000 net reservations after deliveries and cancellations had been received by year-end 219 the special edition model s signature model was sold out before deliveries began in june 2012 and according to tesla all models were sold out for that year shortly after a car ordered in may 2012 would be delivered in early to mid-2013 220 221 initially tesla expected to reach global sales of 35,000 units in 2014 but in november 2014 reduced its sales target to 33,000 units due to a deficit in production of 2,000 units during the third quarter of 2014 the company expected its annual production to increase by over 50 in 2014 to 35,000 units and another increase of 50 in 2015 222 tesla set a target of between 50,000 and 52,000 deliveries for model s and model x cars in 2015 and delivered 50,658 units 223 224 tesla plans to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 new model s and model x vehicles in 2016 224 2012 u.s deliveries began june 2012 10 deliveries of the

hit metal debris on the washington state route 167 highway in kent washington on october 1 2013 381 the driver was able to exit the highway as instructed by the onboard alert system bring the car to a stop and depart the vehicle without injury 382 he then contacted authorities and while awaiting their arrival smoke began coming out the front of the vehicle the driver stated that he hit something while exiting the hov lane 381 383 384 tesla stated that the fire was caused by the direct impact of a large metallic object to one of the 16 battery modules and that by design the modules were separated by firewalls limiting the fire to a small section in the front of the vehicle 381 the module was evidently punctured by a curved section that fell off a truck and was recovered near the accident tesla stated that the debris punched a 3-inch 76 mm diameter hole through the 25-inch 6.4 mm armor plate under the vehicle applying force of some 25 tons built-in vents directed the flames away from the vehicle so that the fire did not enter the passenger compartment according to tesla the firefighters followed standard procedure using large amounts of water to extinguish the fire was correct 385 however puncturing the metal firewall to gain access to the fire also allowed the flames to spread to the front trunk 382 tesla also stated that because the battery pack contains only about 10 of the energy contained in a gasoline tank the effective combustion potential of a single module is only about 1 that of a conventional vehicle 382 on october 24 2013 the u.s national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa announced after reviewing all available data the national highway traffic safety administration has not found evidence at this time that would indicate the recent battery fire involving a tesla model s was the result of a vehicle safety defect or noncompliance with federal safety standards 386 but the following month the nhtsa opened a preliminary evaluation to determine the potential risks associated with undercarriage strikes on model year 2013 tesla model s vehicles 387 388 on march 28 2014 nhtsa closed its investigation claiming that the new titanium underbody shield and aluminum deflector plates along with increased ground clearance should reduce both the frequency of underbody strikes and the resultant fire risk 389 subsequent fires edit on november 6 2013 another fire broke out after a model s struck a tow hitch on the roadway causing damage beneath the vehicle 390 the incidents led tesla to extend its vehicle warranty to cover fire damage and to apply a software update to increase ground clearance when operating at highway speed 387 391 another fire incident took place in toronto canada in early february 2014 the model s was parked in a garage and was not charging when the fire started the origin of the fire is undetermined 392 according to tesla in this particular case we don t yet know the precise cause but have definitively determined that it did not originate in the battery the charging system the adapter or the electrical receptacle as these components were untouched by the fire 393 starting with vehicle bodies manufactured as of 6 march 2014 update all units were outfitted with a triple underbody shield existing cars were retrofitted upon request or as part of a normally scheduled service 394 395 on 1 january 2016 a 2014 model s caught fire in norway while supercharging unsupervised the vehicle was totally destroyed but nobody was injured 396 397 398 the fire was slow and the owner had time to unplug the car and retrieve possessions 399 an investigation by the norwegian accident investigation board aibn indicated that the fire originated in the car but was otherwise inconclusive 400 in march 2016 tesla stated that their own investigation into the incident concluded that the fire was caused by a short circuit in the vehicle s distribution box but that the amount of damage prevented them from determining the exact cause 399 tesla stated that the supercharger detected the short circuit and deactivated and a future model s software update would stop the vehicle from charging if a short circuit is detected 401 recalls edit on november 20 2015 tesla announced a voluntary worldwide recall of all of its 90,000 model s vehicles in order to check for a possible defect in the cars front seat belt assemblies the problem was raised in early november by one customer in europe tesla s resulting investigation was unable to identify a root cause for the failure and the company decided to examine every single car tesla reported that there have been no accidents or injuries related to the problem 402 403 tesla recalled model s from 2012 in january 2017 due to the defective takata airbags cars made later until 2017 have smaller risk and may also be recalled other tesla cars are not affected 404 recognition edit awards edit 2013 autoguide.com reader s choice car of the

103 out of 100 its highest ever the model s broke the rating scale of consumer reports during its most recent test 409 consumer reports 2013 survey of owner satisfaction produced a score of 99 out of 100 the highest the magazine has seen in years 410 in 2014 the model s topped for the second year in a row consumer reports survey of owner satisfaction this time the model s had a score of 98 out of 100 411 consumer reports found the model s to be best overall for 2014 across all 10 categories of cars light trucks and suvs chosen from more than 260 vehicles the organization has recently tested the magazine considers the model s a technological tour de force while pricey is brimming with innovation 412 in 2015 they rated the model s at 103 breaking the scale 413 414 green car reports best

award 421 yahoo autos 2013 car of the year 422 american automobile association green car guide 2015 top spot p85d 423 the model s also won the 2014 aaa green car guide 424 distance records edit as of august 2015 update the distance record is 452.8 mi 728.7 km in a model s on a single charge it was made by norwegian bjørn nyland and his friend morgan tørvolt on a flat stretch with low traffic around the supercharger in rødekro denmark they used hypermiling techniques such as front motor only low speed 39 km h and no airconditioning 425 426 the previous record was 425.8 miles 685.3 km made overnight on february 14 2013 by bruno bowden 427 428 429 the first record of 423.5 miles 681.6 km was set during november 2012 by david and adam metcalf 430 431 these attempts were inspired by a blog written by elon musk about the planned range and efficiency of the tesla model s offering a prize for anyone exceeding 400 miles 640 km on a single charge where it was estimated the 85 kwh model could do it by driving at a constant 36 mph 58 km h under ideal conditions 432 controversies edit range limitation edit on february 8 2013 the new york times published a review by john m broder about a trip between washington d.c. and boston using tesla s supercharger network at the time it included only two stations on the east coast broder made a variety of critical claims about the battery s performance in cold weather and the distance between charging stations the trip ended with the model s carried by a flatbed truck to the milford connecticut station 433 tesla responded by publishing logs of the vehicle s charge levels and driving speed that contradicted broder s account on several factual details 434 tesla implied that broder s behavior forced the car to fail broder replied to the criticism in a blog post and suggested that the speed discrepancies may have been because the car had been equipped with 19-inch wheels rather than the specified 21-inch wheels 435 in the midst of the controversy a cnn reporter recreated broder s trip without exhausting the battery however two key differences distinguished the two journeys the weather was about 10 °f 6 °c warmer and cnn did the trip in one day the times let the car sit overnight without being plugged in 436 a reporter from cnbc also recreated the trip in one day without incidents 437 one week later a group of tesla owners recreated broder s trip without problems one owner was delayed because his car failed to charge and required two firmware updates 438 439 on february 18 2013 new york times public editor margaret sullivan published an editorial stating that broder took casual and imprecise notes of his test drive and did not use good judgment but she maintained that the article was done in good faith she also claimed that broder s vehicle logs were sometimes quite misleading 440 441 442 in july and september 2014 tests performed by an independent german car magazine in cooperation with the tÜv german association for technical inspection and tesla owners seemed to reveal issues with the battery s performance according to the magazine tesla did not take up the invitation to repeat the test and also seemed to refuse to offer vehicles for a second test 443 444 a test performed by another german publication die welt supported the findings 445 nhtsa safest car edit on august 19 2013 based on nhtsa safety ratings a tesla press release claimed that the model s had achieved the best safety rating of any car ever tested tesla stated nhtsa does not publish a star rating above 5 however safety levels better than 5 stars are captured in the overall vehicle safety score vss provided to manufacturers where the model s achieved a new combined record of 5.4 stars 446 447 448 449 450 however a few days later nhtsa rebutted tesla s claim explaining that the rating for the model s was equal to any other car receiving 5-stars and claiming that the carmaker did not follow its advertising guidelines 451 452 453 power dissipation when not in use edit older versions of the system software suffered from power drain issues when the car wasn t being used with the batteries losing 4.5 kwh overnight known commonly as vampire drain 454 system software v5.8 v1.49.30 released december 12 2013 reduced overnight energy loss substantially to 1.1 kwh per night or around 3 miles 90 in january 2014 bjørn nyland a model s owner in norway recorded a range loss of approximately 20 during a 27-day extended vacation an indicated range loss of 63 miles 101 km or 2.3 miles 3.7 km per day while stored in frigid temperatures without any charging cable attached 455 consumer reports recommendation edit in october 2015 two months after naming the tesla the best car ever tested consumer reports declined to give the tesla model s a recommended designation citing too many complaints from owners complaints ranged from minor such as misaligned doors and squeaky body to severe things like total drive train replacement and inoperable door handles tesla s shares dropped 15 both because of the magazine s cut and because of concerns over the tesla model x luxury suv 31 456 similarly edmunds.com found quality and safety issues in their long-term road test and amassed quite the repair résumé during the last 17 months 457 both edmunds and consumer reports reported issues including the vehicle stalling while driving 458 in their 2016 annual auto reliability survey consumer reports improved the model s rating to average reliability while reporting that the model x has had significant malfunction issues the magazine also raised serious concerns about how some automakers including tesla have designed deployed and marketed semi-autonomous technology 32 power discrepancy edit the p85d insane was widely reported to have 691 horsepower 459 460 461 but some owners reported 20 less power on dynamometer in various circumstances 462 463 manufacturers are required by eu law to display power at full setting of the power controller from an external dc source when performing laboratory vehicle approval but not necessarily to show power limited by battery other equipment must be removed or their power added to the measurement 464 465 actual power available depends on circumstances 464 as it does for piston cars 466 which until 1972 could be 25–30 less than given 467 468 as of november 2015 update tesla website showed battery-limited combined 463 hp for p85d 532 hp for ludicrous 469 462 a lawsuit by 126 owners in norway 470 was settled in december 2016 471 autonomy limitations edit the autonomy features of the model s including autosteer and traffic-aware cruise control have limitations that have led to collisions when the driver becomes inattentive 472 tesla warns in the owners manual that drivers always must be aware of road conditions and not rely on the cruise control to prevent a collision 473 as the system may not detect stationary vehicles or obstacles bicycles and pedestrians however critics such as scientist andrew ng have accused tesla of being irresponsible by releasing a product with such limitations as it can lull drivers into a false sense of security 474 electrical consumption of tesla model s edit in early march 2016 a report by stuff magazine revealed that test performed by vicom ltd on behalf of singapore s land transport authority had found a 2014 tesla model s to be consuming 444 wh km 0.715 kw·h mi 475 476 which was greater than the 236 wh km 0.38 kw·h mi reported by the u.s environmental protection agency epa 477 and the 181 wh km 0.291 kw·h mi reported by tesla 478 as a result a carbon surcharge of s 15,000 us 10,900 was imposed on the model s making singapore the only country in the world to impose an environmental surcharge on a fully electric car 479 the land transport authority justified this by stating that it had to account for co 2 emissions during the electricity generation process and therefore a grid emission factor of 0.5g watt-hour was also applied to the electric energy consumption 480 however tesla countered that when the energy used to extract refine and distribute gasoline was taken into account the model s produces approximately one-third the co 2 of an equivalent gasoline-powered vehicle 478 later that month the land transport authority released a statement stating that they and the vicom emission test laboratory will be working with tesla engineers to determine if there was a flaw in the test 481 and a tesla statement indicated that the discussions were positive and that they were confident of a quick resolution 478
