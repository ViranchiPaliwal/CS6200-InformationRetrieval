population growth wikipedia population growth from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search in biology population growth is the increase in the number of individuals in a population global human population growth amounts to around 75 million annually or 1.1 per year the global population has grown from 1 billion in 1800 to 7 billion in 2012 it is expected to keep growing and estimates have put the total population at 8.4 billion by mid-2030 and 9.6 billion by mid-2050 many nations with rapid population growth have low standards of living whereas many nations with low rates of population growth have high standards of living 1 population 2 years passed year billion 1800 1 127 1927 2 33 1960 3 14 1974 4 13 1987 5 12 1999 6 12 2011 7 14 2025 8 18 2043 9 40 2083 10 unfpa united nations population fund estimate 31.10.2011 population growth rate edit the population growth rate is the rate at which the number of individuals in a population increases in a given time period expressed as a fraction of the initial population specifically population growth rate refers to the change in population over a unit time period often expressed as a percentage of the number of individuals in the population at the beginning of that period this can be written as the formula valid for a sufficiently small time interval p o p u l a t i o n g r o w t h r a t e p t 2 − p t 1 p t 1 t 2 − t 1 displaystyle population growth rate frac p t 2 p t 1 p t 1 t 2 t 1 a positive growth rate indicates that the population is increasing while a negative growth rate indicates that the population is decreasing a growth ratio of zero indicates that there were the same number of individuals at the beginning and end of the period—a growth rate may be zero even when there are significant changes in the birth rates death rates immigration rates and age distribution between the two times 3 a related measure is the net reproduction rate in the absence of migration a net reproduction rate of more than 1 indicates that the population of females is increasing while a net reproduction rate less than one sub-replacement fertility indicates that the population of females is decreasing most populations do not grow exponentially rather they follow a logistic model once the population has reached its carrying capacity it will stabilize and the exponential curve will level off towards the carrying capacity which is usually when a population has depleted most its natural resources 4 the logistic growth of a population the logistic equation d p d t k p 1 − p k displaystyle frac dp dt kp 1 frac p k where p t displaystyle p t the population after time t t displaystyle t time a population grows k displaystyle k relative growth rate coefficient k displaystyle k carrying capacity of the population defined by ecologists as the maximum population size that a particular environment can sustain 4 the analytic logistic solution this is a separable differential equation that can be derived through integration the analytic solution is useful in analyzing the behavior of population models 5 the equation is separable and to find the solution we integrate ∫ d p p 1 − p k ∫ k ⋅ d t displaystyle int frac dp p 1 frac p k int k cdot dt working on just the left side of the equation the fraction in the denominator is eliminated by multiplying the variable k and then the fraction is split in 2 1 p 1 − p k ⋅ k k k p k − p displaystyle frac 1 p 1 frac p k cdot frac k k frac k p k-p k p k − p 1 p 1 k − p displaystyle frac k p k-p frac 1 p frac 1 k-p the partial fraction is then integrated more easily ∫ 1 p 1 k − p d p ∫ k ⋅ d t displaystyle int frac 1 p frac 1 k-p dp int k cdot dt after integrating and using u substitution we get − ln ⁡ p ln ⁡ k − p − k t −

axis is logarithmic and is in millions of people world population growth rates between 1950–2050 in 2009 the estimated annual growth rate was 1.1 6 the cia world factbook gives the world annual birthrate mortality rate and growth rate as 1.86 0.78 and 1.08 respectively 7 the last 100 years have seen a massive fourfold increase in the population due to medical advances lower mortality rates and an increase in agricultural productivity 8 made possible by the green revolution the annual increase in the number of living humans peaked at 88.0 million in 1989 then slowly declined to 73.9 million in 2003 after which it rose again to 75.2 million in 2006 in 2009 the human population increased by 74.6 million 6 generally developed nations have seen a decline in their growth rates in recent decades though annual growth rates remain above 2 in poverty-stricken countries of the middle east and sub-saharan africa and also in south asia southeast asia and latin america 9 in some countries the population is declining especially in eastern europe mainly due to low fertility rates high death rates and emigration in southern africa growth is slowing due to the high number of aids-related deaths some western europe countries might also experience population decline 10 japan s population began decreasing in 2005 it now has the highest standard of living in the world 11 the united nations population division projects world population to peak at over 10 billion at the end of the 21st century but sanjeev sanyal has argued that global fertility will fall below the replacement rate in the 2020s and that world population will peak below 9 billion by 2050 followed by a long decline 12 a 2014 study in science concludes that the global population will reach 11 billion by 2100 with a 70 chance of continued growth into the 22nd century 13 growth by country edit according to united nations population statistics the world population grew by 30 or 1.6 billion humans between 1990 and 2010 14 in number of people the increase was highest in india 350 million and china 196 million population growth was among highest in the united arab emirates 315 and qatar

article projections of population growth estimated size of human population from 10,000 bce to 2000 ce the majority of world population growth today is occurring in less developed countries according to the un s 2010 revision to its population projections world population is projected to peak at 10.1 billion in 2100 compared to 7 billion in 2011 72 a 2014 paper by demographers from several universities and the united nations population division projected that the world s population would reach about 10.9 billion in 2100 and continue growing thereafter 73 one of its authors adrian raftery a university of washington professor of statistics and of sociology says the consensus over the past 20 years or so was that world population which is currently around 7 billion would go up to 9 billion and level off or probably decline we found there’s a 70 percent probability the world population will not stabilize this century population which had sort of fallen off the world’s agenda remains a very important issue 74 however some experts dispute the un s figures and have argued that birth rates will fall below replacement rate in the 2020s according to their projections population growth will be only sustained till the 2040s by rising longevity but will peak below 9 bn by 2050 12
