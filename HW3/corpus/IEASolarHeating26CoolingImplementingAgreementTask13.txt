vice chairs he tao michaela meir daniel mugnier establishment 1977 website www.iea-shc.org the international energy agency solar heating and cooling programme iea shc is one of over 40 multilateral technology collaboration programmes also known as tcps of the international energy agency 1 it was one of the first of such programmes founded in 1977 its current mission is to advance international collaborative efforts for solar energy to reach the goal set in the vision of contributing 50 of the low temperature heating and cooling demand by 2030 2 its international solar collector statistics solar heat worldwide 3 serve as a reference document for governments 4 financial institutions 5 consulting firms 6 and non-profit organizations 7 membership and organization edit the iea shc s members are national governments the european commission and international organizations each of the members is represented by one representative in the management body called the executive committee 8 the iea shc executive committee meets twice per year and is headed by an elected chairman the iea shc currently has 26 members australia austria belgium canada china denmark france germany italy mexico netherlands norway portugal singapore south africa spain sweden switzerland turkey united kingdom european commission ecreee european copper institute gulf organization for research and development ises rcreee 9 fields of work edit research development and demonstration edit the iea shc aims at facilitating international collaboration in the research development and demonstration of solar thermal energy and solar buildings their multi-year projects also known as tasks are conducted by researchers from different countries funding is provided by iea shc members who usually pay one or more national research institutions to participate in the work research topics include solar space heating e.g solar and heat pump systems task 44 10 solar combisystems task 26 11 solar industrial process heat e.g solar process heat for production and advanced applications task 49 12 solar heat for industrial process task 33 13 solar district heating e.g towards the integration of large systems into district heating and cooling network task 55 large systems large solar heating cooling systems seasonal storage heat pumps task 45 14 solar cooling e.g new generation solar cooling and heating systems pv or solar thermally driven systems task 53 quality assurance and support measures for solar cooling task 48 15 solar air-conditioning and refrigeration task 38 16 solar buildings architecture e.g building integrated solar envelope systems for hvac and lighting task 56 solar energy and energy economics in urban environments task 52 solar energy in urban planning task 51 solar renovation of non-residential buildings task 47 17 solar energy and architecture task 41 18 as well as work on materials components for solar heating and cooling e.g price reduction for solar thermal systems task 54 compact thermal energy storage task 42 19 polymeric materials for solar thermal applications task 39 20 standards certification e.g solar standards and certification task 57 solar rating certification procedure task 43 21 resource assessment e.g solar resource assessment and forecasting task 46 solar resource knowledge management task 36 22 task 13 edit the idea behind task 13 was to push construction technology towards its limits to achieve the lowest possible total purchased energy consumption task 13 was part of the iea solar heating and cooling programme to test the designs and techniques and to monitor their performance on average the houses were designed to required 44 kwh m² 75 lower than the average 172 kwh m² that would have been required had the houses been built to normal standards analysis of 11 of the houses in use indicated that total savings made in practice was actually 60 1 the 44 kwh m² resulted from electricity – 18 kwh m² space heating – 14 kwh m² water heating – 11 kwh m² cooling – 1 kwh m² in addition there was an average solar contribution designed to average 37 kwh m² from a combination of passive solar gains active solar and photovoltaics the buildings were constructed to be airtight be superinsulated to roughly double normal standards and to minimise thermal bridges masonry and several timber framed methods were represented along with a novel steel strengthened polystyrene block walls were used the berlin zero heating energy house included a 20m³ 700 cubic feet seasonal thermal store 2 the homes in the programme were pleiade row house louvain-la-neuve belgium brampton advanced house canada waterloo region green home canada 3 kolding row house denmark iea 5 house pietarsaari finland ultrahouse rottweil germany 4 zero heating energy house berlin germany 5 wish house 3 iwaki japan 6 urban villa amstelveen netherlands 7 iea task 13 house hamar norway 8 roskar low energy house sweden duplex in gelterkinden switzerland exemplary house grand canyon united states exemplary house yosemite usa among the lessons learned were that airtightness was difficult to achieve ventilation systems could suffer from noise and draft problems care was needed to design out summer overheating simple installations and systems were easier for the residents to understand for a report on the task 13 findings see energy design update december 2003 international shc conference edit in 2011 the iea shc executive committee announced an annual international conference on solar heating and cooling for buildings and industry the first conference shc 2012 took place 9–11 july 2012 in san francisco 23 shc 2013 on 23–25 september 2013 in freiburg germany. shc 2014 on 13–15 october in beijing china shc 2015 on 2–4 december in istanbul turkey shc 2013 and shc 2015 were jointly with the european solar thermal industry federation estif which had previously organized their own conference estec publications edit apart from the reports and other publications of the research projects tasks the solar heating and cooling programme publishes several cross-cutting documents the most important one being the annual collector statistics solar heat worldwide 3 the shc newsletter solar update is published twice per year 24
