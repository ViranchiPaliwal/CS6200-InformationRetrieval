electricity sector has increased from 6.3 in 2000 to about 34 in 2016 1 on sunday 15 may 2016 at 14 00 hours renewables supplied nearly all of domestic electricity demand 2 while peak-generation from combined wind and solar reached a previous all-time high of 74 in april 2014 3 wind power saw its best day ever on december 12 2014 generating 562 gwh 4 germany has been called the world s first major renewable energy economy 5 6 more than 23,000 wind turbines and 1.4 million solar pv systems are distributed all over the country s area of 357,000 square kilometers 7 8 as of 2011 germany s federal government is working on a new plan for increasing renewable energy commercialization 9 with a particular focus on offshore wind farms 10 a major challenge is the development of sufficient network capacities for transmitting the power generated in the north sea to the large industrial consumers in southern parts of the country 11 according to official figures some 370,000 people were employed in the renewable energy sector in 2010 especially in small and medium-sized companies this is an increase of around 8 compared to 2009 around 339,500 jobs and well over twice the number of jobs in 2004 160,500 about two-thirds of these jobs are attributed to the renewable energy sources act 12 13 germany s energy transition the energiewende designates a significant change in energy policy from 2011 the term encompasses a reorientation of policy from demand to supply and a shift from centralized to distributed generation for example producing heat and power in very small cogeneration units

the directive on electricity production from renewable energy sources in 1997 germany and the other states of the european union were working towards a target of 12 renewable electricity by 2010 germany passed this target early in 2007 when the renewable energy share in electricity consumption in germany reached 14 14 in september 2010 the german government announced ambitious energy targets 15 5 after the 2013 elections the new cdu csu and spd coalition government continued the energy transition with only minor modifications of its targets in the coalition agreement 16 these targets

wind turbines and biomass plants generated more than 123 twh of electricity providing nearly 20 of the 603 twh of electricity supplied 18 in 2012 all renewable energy accounted for 21.9 of electricity with wind turbines and photovoltaic providing 11.9 of the total 19 chancellor angela merkel along with a vast majority of her compatriots believes as the first big industrialized nation we can achieve such a transformation toward efficient and renewable energies with all the opportunities that brings for exports developing new technologies and jobs 20 as of 2016 renewable sources account for 33.9 of the net electricity production compared to the same period of 2015 energy production from renewable energy sources remained on the same level while it increased for gas by 15.1 twh and decreased for the remaining fossil fuels by 16.6 twh the increase in energy production from gas can be traced back to low gas prices 1 4,5 primary energy consumption edit as of 2015 germany s primary energy consumption of 13 218 petajoules or 3 672 terawatt-hours refers to the total energy used by the nation the final renewable energy consumption split by the sectors and with their relative share are 21

consumption of 5.3 33.611 gwh as of the end of 2015 renewable energy sources such as biomass biogas biofuels hydro wind and solar accounted for 12.4 of the country s primary energy consumption a more than doubling compared to 2004 when renewables only contributed 4.5 21 5 although the terms energy and electricity are often used interchangeably they should not be confused with one another as electricity is only one form of energy and does not account for the energy consumed by combustion engines and heat boilers used in transportation by vehicles and for the heating of buildings source

according to ewea in a normal wind year installed wind capacity in germany will meet 10.6 at end 2011 and 9.3 at end 2010 of the german electricity needs 26 27 more than 21,607 wind turbines are located in the german federal area and the country has plans to build more 28 29 as of 2011 germany s federal government is working on a new plan for increasing renewable energy commercialization 9 with a particular focus on offshore wind farms 10 a major challenge is the development of sufficient network capacities for transmitting the power generated in the north sea to the large industrial consumers in southern germany 11 in 2016 germany decided to replace feed-in tariffs with auctions from 2017 30 biomass edit the key provider of biomass supply in germany is supposed to be agriculture moreover 40 of german wood production is also used as a biomass feedstock 31 the german federal research centre for forestry and forest products claims that there are also reserves which may assist in enlarging the part of forestry in biomass production agriculture is the main source of rapeseed oil which is used for the production of biodiesel and making substrates for the production of biogas 32 biomass used for the production of biogas and biofuels are some of germany s most important sources of renewable energy in 2010 biomass accounted for 30 of renewable electricity generation and for 70 of all renewable energy mostly wood 33 germany has committed to blending 6.25 biofuels in petroleum by 2014 with the biofuels quota act 34 35 photovoltaic solar power edit main articles solar power in

generates electricity from sunlight and it can be used in grid-connected and off-grid applications they were first mass-produced in the year 2000 when german environmentalists and eurosolar have succeeded in obtaining the government support for the 100,000 roofs program 37 in july 2012 a cumulative installed total solar pv power of 29.7 gw was in place 38 solar pv provided 18 tw·h in 2011 3 of the total electricity demand as solar power installations rise quickly in first half of 2012 about 5.3 of the total electricity demand was covered by solar power 39 on saturday may 25 2012 solar power broke a new record high feeding 22 gw into the power grid or as much as 20 nuclear power stations this jump above the 20 gw level was due to increased capacity and excellent weather conditions countrywide and made up for half of the nation s electricity demand at midday 40 germany was also the biggest expanding market for solar pv 2012 with 7.6 gw of newly connected systems 41 some market analysts expect the solar electricity share could reach 25 by 2050 42 price of pv systems has decreased more than 50 in 5 years since 2006 43 hydroelectricity edit the total installed hydroelectic capacity in germany at the end of 2006 was 4.7 gw hydropower meets 3.5 of the electricity demand latest estimates show in germany in 2007 about 9,400 people were employed in the hydropower sector which generated a total turnover of €1.23 billion 44 geothermal power edit main article geothermal power in germany geothermal power in germany is expected to grow mainly because of a law that benefits the production of geothermal electricity and guarantees a feed-in tariff but after a renewable energy law that introduced a tariff scheme of €0.15 us 0.23 per kilowatt-hour kwh for electricity produced from geothermal sources came into effect that year a construction boom was sparked and the new power plants are now starting to come online industry edit annual yield of domestic

rotor in germany are german and german turbines and generators used in hydro energy generation are among the most popular worldwide 45 nearly 800,000 people work in the german environment technology sector an estimated 214,000 people work with renewables in germany up from 157,000 in 2004 an increase of 36 45 siemens chief executive peter löscher believes germany’s target of generating 35 of its energy from renewables by 2020 is achievable – and most probably profitable for europe’s largest engineering company its “environmental solutions” portfolio which is firmly focused on renewables is “already generating more than €27 billion a year 35 per cent of siemens’ total revenue and the plan is to grow this to €40 billion by 2015” ending its involvement in nuclear industry will boost the credibility of siemens as a purveyor of “green technology” 46 germany s main competitors in solar electricity are japan the us and china in the wind industry it is denmark spain and the us government policy edit the renewable energy sector benefited when the alliance 90 the greens party joined the federal government between 1998 and 2005 support for renewable energy continued under all following governments regardless of composition including the current cdu csu and spd coalition government starting in 2013 16 the renewable energy sector was aided especially by the renewable energy sources act that promotes renewable energy mainly by stipulating feed-in tariffs and recently also market premiums that grid operators must pay for renewable energy fed into the power grid people who produce renewable energy can sell their product at fixed prices for a period of 20 or 15 years this has created a surge in the production of renewable energy 47 in 2012 siemens estimated the total cost of renewable energy would come to at least €1.4 trillion us 1.8 trillion by 2030 48 for the 2011–2014 period the federal government set aside 3.5 billion euros for scientific research in the country 49 additionally in 2001 a law was passed requiring the closing of all nuclear power plants within a period of 32 years the shutdown time was extended to 2040 by a new government in 2010 after the fukushima incident the law was abrogated and the end of nuclear energy was set to 2022 50 after the 2013 federal elections the new cdu csu and spd coalition in important areas continued the energiewende of the previous government but also agreed on a major revision of the eeg 51 the german energy policy is framed within the european union and the march 2007 european council in brussels approved a mandatory energy plan that requires a 20 reduction of carbon dioxide emissions before the year 2020 and the consumption of renewable energies to be 20 of total eu consumption compared to 7 in 2006 52 the accord indirectly acknowledged the role of nuclear energy — which is not commonly regarded as renewable but emissions-free — in the reduction of the emission of greenhouse gases allowing each member state to decide whether or not to use nuclear-generated electricity 53 also a compromise was reached to achieve a minimum quota of 10 biofuels in the total consumption of gasoline and diesel in transport in 2020 energy transition edit main articles energy transition and energy transition in germany energiewende energy transition designates a significant change in energy policy the term encompasses a reorientation of policy from demand to supply and a shift from centralized to distributed generation for example producing heat and power in very small cogeneration units which should replace overproduction and avoidable energy consumption with energy-saving measures and increased efficiency the key policy document outlining the energiewende was published by the german government in september 2010 some six months before the fukushima nuclear accident 15 legislative support was passed in september 2010 important aspects include key energiewende policy targets with actual figures for 2015 17 target 2015 2020 2030 2040 2050 greenhouse gas emissions base year 1990 −27.2 −40 −55 −70 −80 to −95 renewable energy share of gross final energy consumption 14.9 18 30 45

−25 provisional figure for 2015 in addition there will be an associated research and development drive the policy has been embraced by the german federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables particularly wind power germany s share of renewables has increased from around 5 in 1999 to 22.9 in 2012 reaching close to the oecd average of 18 usage of renewables 54 producers have been guaranteed a fixed feed-in tariff for 20 years guaranteeing a fixed income energy co-operatives have been created and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits the large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market nuclear power plants were closed and the existing nine plants will close earlier than planned in 2022 in may 2013 the international energy agency commended germany for its commitment to developing a comprehensive energy transition strategy ambitious renewable energy goals and plans to increase efficient energy use and supported this approach nevertheless the scale of germany’s energy policy ambitions coupled with the large size and energy intensity of its economy and its central location in europe’s energy system mean further policy measures must be developed if the country’s ambitious energy transition is to maintain a workable balance between sustainability affordability and competitiveness 55 subsidies aimed at stimulating the growth of renewables have driven up consumer energy prices by 12.5 in 2013 56 to date german consumers have absorbed the costs of the energiewende but the iea says the debate over the social and economic impacts of the new approach has become more prominent as the share of renewable energy has continued to grow alongside rising electricity prices the transition to a low-carbon energy sector requires public acceptance and therefore retail electricity prices must remain at an affordable level presently german electricity prices are among the highest in europe despite relatively low wholesale prices 55 at the same time the iea said the new energy policy is based on long-term investment decisions and a strong policy consensus in germany in favour of large-scale renewable energy commercialisation exists 55 ownership edit in germany almost half of renewable power capacity was citizen-owned as of 2013 and about 20 million germans lived in so-called 100 renewable energy regions 57 jobs edit estimated german jobs in renewable energy in 2012–2013 were about 370,000 58 statistics edit increases in installed renewable electric power capacity and
