april 2016 velomobile the most efficient means of passenger transportation energy efficiency in transportation is strictly speaking useful output kilometers miles etc divided by total energy input kilowatt-hour amount of gasoline etc this is more precisely known as fuel economy symbol fe and commonly measured in units of km l or mi gal mpg 1 2 energy efficiency in transportation is often and confusingly described in terms of fuel consumption symbol fc fuel consumption is the reciprocal of fuel economy 2 and is occasionally known as energy intensity 3 it equals fuel energy divided by distance and is often measured in units of liters per 100 kilometers l 100 km joules per kilometer j km gallon-equivalent per 100 miles gal e 100 mi or kilowatt-hours per distance kw-hr km or kw-hr mi the energy efficiency in transportation varies by mode of transportation listed below different types of transportation range from some hundred kilojoules per kilometre kj km for a bicycle to tens of megajoules per kilometer mj km for a helicopter units of measurement edit both fuel economy and fuel consumption are often given on a per-vehicle basis more refined units of measurement exist such as fuel consumption per passenger or fuel consumption per mass of cargo energy efficiency is expressed in terms of fuel economy 2 distance per vehicle per unit fuel volume e.g. km l or miles per gallon us or imperial distance per vehicle per unit fuel mass e.g. km kg 4 distance per vehicle per unit energy e.g. miles per gallon equivalent mpg-e energy intensity reciprocal efficiency 3 is expressed terms of fuel consumption 2 volume of fuel or total energy consumed per unit distance per vehicle e.g l 100 km or mj 100 km volume of fuel or total energy consumed per unit distance per passenger e.g. l 100 passenger·km volume of fuel or total energy consumed per unit distance per unit mass of cargo transported e.g. l 100 kg·km or mj t·km electricity used per vehicle per unit distance e.g. kw·h 100 km transportation types edit for freight transport rail and ship transport are generally much more efficient than trucking and air freight is much less efficient 5 6 walking edit nordic walkers a 68 kg 150 lb person walking at 4 km h 2.5 mph requires approximately 210 kilocalories 880 kj of food energy per hour which is equivalent to 4.55 km mj 7 1 us gal 3.8 l of gasoline contains about 114,000 british thermal units 120 mj 8 of energy so this is approximately equivalent to 360 miles per us gallon 0.65 l 100 km velomobile edit main article velomobile velomobiles have the highest energy efficiency of any known mode of personal transportation at a speed of 50 km h 31 mph the velomobile manufacturer waw claims that only 0.5 kw·h of food energy per 100 km is needed to transport the passenger which is around 1 ⁄ 5 20 of what is needed to power a standard upright bicycle and 1 ⁄ 50 2 of that which is consumed by an average fossil fuel or electric car this corresponds to 4700 miles per us gallon 2000 km l 0.05 l 100 km 9 other sources give a figure of 1 ⁄ 3.4 29.5 of the energy use of a normal bicycle 10 bicycling edit a chinese flying pigeon bicycle a lightweight and moderate-speed vehicle with low-friction tires and an efficient chain-driven drivetrain the bicycle is one of the most energy-efficient forms of transportation compared with walking a 64 kg 140 lb cyclist riding at 16 km h 10 mph requires about half the food energy per unit distance 43 kcal mi 27 kcal km or 3.1 kw·h 11 mj per 100 km 7 this converts to about 732 mpg ‑us 0.321 l 100 km 879 mpg ‑imp 11 this means that a bicycle will use between 10-25 times less energy per distance traveled than a personal car depending on fuel source and size of the car this figure does depend on the speed and mass of the rider greater speeds give higher air drag and heavier riders consume more energy per unit distance in addition because bicycles are very lightweight usually between 7-15 kg this means they consume very low amounts of materials and energy to manufacture especially in comparison to an automobile weighing 1500kg or more this means that a bicycle typically requires 100-200 times less energy to produce than an automobile which for an automobile can make up a large portion of its total energy use as discussed below in the automobile section a motorized bicycle allows human power and the assistance of a 49 cm 3 3.0 cu in engine giving a range of 160 to 200 mpg ‑us 1.5–1.2 l 100 km 190–240 mpg ‑imp citation needed electric pedal-assisted bikes run on as little as 1.0 kw·h 3.6 mj per 100 km citation needed while maintaining speeds in excess of 30 km h 19 mph citation needed these best-case figures rely on a human doing 70 of the work with around 3.6 mj 1.0 kw·h per 100 km coming from the motor this makes an electric bicycle one of the most efficient possible motorized vehicles behind only a motorized velomobile human power edit to be thorough a comparison must also consider the energy costs of producing transporting and packaging of fuel food or fossil fuel the energy incurred in disposing of exhaust waste and the energy costs of manufacturing the vehicle this last can be significant given that walking requires little or no special equipment while automobiles for example require a great deal of energy to produce and have relatively short lifespans in addition any comparison of electric vehicles and liquid-fuelled vehicles must include the fuel consumed in the power station to generate the electricity in the uk for instance the efficiency of the electricity generation and distribution system is around 0.40 citation needed automobiles edit main article fuel economy in automobiles see also fuel economy-maximizing behaviors bugatti veyron automobile fuel efficiency is most commonly expressed in terms of the volume of fuel consumed per one hundred kilometres l 100 km but in some countries including the usa uk and india it is more commonly expressed in terms of the distance per volume fuel consumed km l or miles per us or imperial gallon this is complicated by the different energy content of fuels such as petrol and diesel the oak ridge national laboratory ornl states that the energy content of unleaded gasoline is 115,000 british thermal unit btu per us gallon 32 mj l compared to 130,500 btu per us gallon 36.4 mj l for diesel 12 a second important consideration is the energy costs of producing energy bio-fuels electricity and hydrogen for instance have significant energy inputs in their production because of this the efficiency of 50-70 from natural gas or 10-15 from electricity of hydrogen production as well as the vast amounts of energy required to store and transport hydrogen must to be combined with the vehicle efficiency to yield net efficiency 13 because of this hydrogen automobiles are one of the least efficient means of passenger transportation generally around 50 times as much energy must be put into the production of hydrogen compared to how much is used to move the car a third consideration to take into account is the occupancy rate of the vehicle as the number of passengers per vehicle increases the consumption per unit distance per vehicle increases however this increase is slight compared to the reduction in consumption per unit distance per passenger we can compare for instance the estimated average occupancy rate of about 1.3 passengers per car in the san francisco bay area 14 to the 2006 uk estimated average of 1.58 15 fourth the energy needed to build and maintain roads is an important consideration as is the energy returned on energy invested eroei between these two factors roughly 20 must be added to the energy of the fuel consumed to accurately account for the total energy used citation needed finally vehicle energy efficiency calculations would be misleading without factoring the energy cost of producing the vehicle itself this initial energy cost can of course be depreciated over the life of the vehicle to calculate an average energy efficiency over its effective life span in other words vehicles that take a lot of energy to produce and are used for relatively short periods will require a great deal more energy over their effective lifespan than those that do not and are therefore much less energy efficient than they may otherwise seem hybrid and electric cars use less energy in their operation than comparable petroleum-fueled cars but more energy is used to manufacture them so the overall difference would be less than immediately apparent compare for example walking which requires no special equipment at all and an automobile produced in and shipped from another country and made from parts manufactured around the world from raw materials and minerals mined and processed elsewhere again and used for a limited number of years according to the french energy and environment agency ademe 16 an average motor car has an embodied energy content of 20,800 kwh and an average electric vehicle amounts to 34,700 kwh the electric car requires nearly twice as much energy to produce primarily due to the large amount of mining and purification necessary for the rare earth metals and other materials used in lithium-ion batteries and in the electric drive motors this represents a significant portion of the energy used over the life of the car in some cases nearly as much as energy that is used through the fuel that is consumed effectively doubling the car s per-distance energy consumption and cannot be ignored when comparing automobiles to other transportation modes it is important to note also that as these are average numbers for french automobiles and they are are likely to be significantly larger in more auto-centric countries like the united states and canada where much larger and heavier cars are more common driving practices and vehicles can be modified to improve their energy efficiency by about 15 17 18 on a percentage basis if there is one occupant in an automobile between 0.4-0.6 of the total energy used is used to move the person in the car while 99.4-99.6 about 165 to 250 times more is used to move the car example consumption figures edit two american solar cars in canada solar cars use no externally supplied fuel other than sunlight charging the batteries entirely from built-in solar panels and typically use less than 3 kw·h per 100 miles 67 kj km or 1.86 kw·h 100 km these cars are not designed for passenger or utility use and would not be practical as such due to speed payload and inherent design 19 the four passenger gem ner uses 169 wh mi 203 mpg‑e 10.5 kw·h 100 km 20 which equates to 2.6 kw·h 100 km per person when fully occupied albeit at only 24 mph 39 km h the

chevrolet volt in full electric mode uses 36 kilowatt-hours per 100 miles 810 kj km 96 mpg‑e meaning it may approach or exceed the energy efficiency of walking if the car is fully occupied with 4 or more passengers although the relative emissions produced may not follow the same trends if analyzing environmental impacts the daihatsu charade 993cc turbo diesel 1987–1993 won the most fuel efficient vehicle award for going round the united kingdom consuming an average of 2.82 l 100 km 100 mpg ‑imp it was surpassed only recently by the vw lupo 3 l which consumes about 2.77 l 100 km 102 mpg ‑imp both cars are rare to find on the popular market the daihatsu had major problems with rust and structural safety which contributes to its rarity and the quite short production run the volkswagen polo

principal determinant of energy consumption in aircraft is drag which must be opposed by thrust for the aircraft to progress drag is proportional to the lift required for flight 30 which is equal to the weight of the aircraft as induced drag increases with weight mass reduction with improvements in engine efficiency and reductions in aerodynamic drag has been a principal source of efficiency gains in aircraft with a rule-of-thumb being that a 1 weight reduction corresponds to around a 0.75 reduction in fuel consumption 30 flight altitude affects engine efficiency jet-engine efficiency increases at altitude up to the tropopause the temperature minimum of the atmosphere at lower temperatures the carnot efficiency is higher 30 jet engine efficiency is also increased at high speeds but above about mach 0.85 the airframe aerodynamic losses increase faster compressibility effects beginning at transonic speeds of around mach 0.85 shockwaves form increasing drag for supersonic flight it is difficult to achieve a lift to drag ratio greater than 5 and fuel consumption is increased in proportion concorde fuel efficiency comparison assuming jets are filled to capacity aircraft concorde

overall fuel efficiency gain if one were to exclude the inefficient and limited fleet of the dh comet 4 and to consider the boeing 707 as the base case 33 most of the improvements in efficiency were gained in the first decade when jet craft first came into widespread commercial use compared to advanced piston engine airliners of the 1950s current jet airliners are only marginally more efficient per passenger-mile 34 between 1971 and 1998 the fleet-average annual improvement per available seat-kilometre was estimated at 2.4 concorde the supersonic transport managed about 17 passenger-miles to the imperial gallon similar to a business jet but much worse than a subsonic turbofan aircraft airbus puts the fuel rate consumption of their a380 at less than 3 l 100 km per passenger 78 passenger-miles per us gallon 35 air france airbus a380-800 the mass of an aircraft can be reduced by using light-weight materials such as titanium carbon fiber and other composite plastics expensive materials may be used if the reduction of mass justifies the price of materials through improved fuel efficiency the improvements achieved in fuel efficiency by mass reduction reduces the amount of fuel that needs to be carried this further reduces the mass of the aircraft and therefore enables further gains in fuel efficiency for example the airbus a380 design includes multiple light-weight materials airbus has showcased wingtip devices sharklets or winglets that can achieve 3.5 percent reduction in fuel consumption 36 37 there are wingtip devices on the airbus a380 further developed minix winglets have been said to offer 6 percent reduction in fuel consumption 38 winglets at the tip of an aircraft wing smooth out the wing-tip vortex reducing the aircraft s wing drag and can be retrofitted to any airplane 38 nasa and boeing are conducting tests on a 500 lb 230 kg blended wing aircraft this design allows for greater fuel efficiency since the whole craft produces lift not just the wings 39 the blended wing body bwb concept offers advantages in structural aerodynamic and operating efficiencies over today s more conventional fuselage-and-wing designs these features translate into greater range fuel economy reliability and life cycle savings as well as lower manufacturing costs 40 41 nasa has created a cruise efficient stol cestol concept fraunhofer institute for manufacturing engineering and applied materials research ifam have researched a shark skin imitating paint that would reduce drag through a riblet effect 42 aircraft are a major potential application for new technologies such as aluminium metal foam and nanotechnology such as the shark skin imitating paint propfan propulsors are a more fuel efficient technology than jets or turboprops but turboprops have an optimum speed below about 450 mph 700 km h 43 this speed is less than used with jets by major airlines today however the decrease in speed reduces drag with the current needs update high price for jet fuel and the emphasis on engine airframe efficiency to reduce emissions there is renewed interest in the propfan concept for jetliners that might come into service beyond the boeing 787 and airbus a350 xwb for instance airbus has patented aircraft designs with twin rear-mounted counter-rotating propfans 44 nasa has conducted an advanced turboprop project atp where they researched a variable pitch propfan that produced less noise and achieved high speeds related to fuel efficiency is the impact of aviation emissions on climate small aircraft edit dyn aéro mcr4s motor-gliders

sailboat much like a solar car can locomote without consuming any fuel a sail boat such as a dinghy using just wind power requires no input energy in terms of fuel however some manual energy is required by the crew to steer the boat and adjust the sails using ropes in addition energy will be needed for demands other than propulsion such as cooking heating or lighting the fuel efficiency of a single-occupancy boat is highly dependent on the size of its engine the speed at which it travels and its displacement due to the high viscosity of water with a single passenger the equivalent energy efficiency will be lower than in a car train or plane trains edit trains are in general one of the most efficient means of transport for freight and passengers efficiency varies significantly with passenger loads and losses incurred in electricity generation and supply for electrified systems 51 52 and importantly end-to-end delivery where stations are not the originating final destinations of a journey actual consumption depends on gradients maximum speeds loading and stopping patterns data produced for the european meet project methodologies for estimating air pollutant emissions
