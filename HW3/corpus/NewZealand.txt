zealand is situated some 1,500 kilometres 900 mi east of australia across the tasman sea and roughly 1,000 kilometres 600 mi south of the pacific island areas of new caledonia fiji and tonga because of its remoteness it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans during its long period of isolation new zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal fungal and plant life the country s varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks such as the southern alps owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions new zealand s capital city is wellington while its most populous city is auckland sometime between 1250 and 1300 ce polynesians settled in the islands that later were named new zealand and developed a distinctive māori culture in 1642 dutch explorer abel tasman became the first european to sight new zealand 11 in 1840 representatives of britain and māori chiefs signed the treaty of waitangi which declared british sovereignty over the islands in 1841 new zealand became a colony within the british empire and in 1907 it became a dominion today the majority of new zealand s population of 4.7 million is of european descent the indigenous māori are the largest minority followed by asians and pacific islanders reflecting this new zealand s culture is mainly derived from māori and early british settlers with recent broadening arising from increased immigration the official languages are english māori and new zealand sign language with english predominant new zealand is a developed country and ranks highly in international comparisons of national

1642 and called it staten landt supposing it was connected to a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of south america 12 in 1645 dutch cartographers renamed the land nova zeelandia after the dutch province of zeeland 13 14 british explorer james cook subsequently anglicised the name to new zealand 15 16 aotearoa often translated as land of the long white cloud 17 is the current māori name for new zealand it is unknown whether māori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of europeans with aotearoa originally referring to just the north island 18 māori had several traditional names for the two main islands including te ika-a-māui the fish of māui for the north island and te waipounamu the waters of greenstone or te waka o aoraki the canoe of aoraki for the south island 19 early european maps labelled the islands north north island middle south island and south stewart island rakiura 20 in 1830 maps began to use north and south to distinguish the two largest islands and by 1907 this was the accepted norm 16 the new zealand geographic board discovered in 2009 that the names of the north island and south island had never been formalised and names and alternative names were formalised in 2013 this set the names as north island or te ika-a-māui and south island or te waipounamu 21 for each island either its english or māori name can be used or both can be used together 21 history main article history of new zealand the māori people are most likely descended from people who emigrated from taiwan to melanesia and then travelled east through to the society islands after a pause of 70 to 265 years a new wave of exploration led to the discovery and settlement of new zealand 22 new zealand was one of the last major landmasses settled by humans radiocarbon dating evidence of deforestation 23 and mitochondrial dna variability within māori populations 24 suggest new zealand was first settled by eastern polynesians between 1250 and 1300 19 25 concluding a long series of voyages through the southern pacific islands 26 over the centuries that followed these settlers developed a distinct culture now known as māori the population was divided into iwi tribes and hapū subtribes who would sometimes cooperate sometimes compete and sometimes fight against each other at some point a group of māori migrated to the chatham islands which they named rēkohu where they developed their distinct moriori culture 27 28 the moriori population was all but wiped out between 1835 and 1862 largely because of taranaki māori invasion and enslavement in the 1830s although european diseases also contributed in 1862 only 101 survived and the last known full-blooded moriori died in 1933 29 the first europeans known to have reached new zealand were dutch explorer abel tasman and his crew in 1642 30 in a hostile encounter four crew members were killed and at least one māori was hit by canister shot 31 europeans did not revisit new zealand until 1769 when british explorer james cook mapped almost the entire coastline 30 following cook new zealand was visited by numerous european and north american whaling sealing and trading ships they traded european food metal tools weapons and other goods for timber māori food artifacts and water 32 the introduction of the potato and the musket transformed māori agriculture and warfare potatoes provided a reliable food surplus which enabled longer and more sustained military campaigns 33 the resulting intertribal musket wars encompassed over 600 battles between 1801 and 1840 killing 30,000–40,000 māori 34 from the early 19th century christian missionaries began to settle new zealand eventually converting most of the māori population 35 the māori population declined to around 40 of its pre-contact level during the 19th century introduced diseases were the major factor 36 the waitangi sheet from the treaty of waitangi in 1788 captain arthur phillip assumed the position of governor of the new british colony of new south wales which according to his commission included new zealand 37 the british government appointed james busby as british resident to new zealand in 1832 following a petition from northern māori 38 in 1835 following an announcement of impending french settlement by charles de thierry the nebulous united tribes of new zealand sent a declaration of the independence to king william iv of the united kingdom asking for protection 38 ongoing unrest the proposed settlement of new zealand by the new zealand company which had already sent its first ship of surveyors to buy land from māori and the dubious legal standing of the declaration of independence prompted the colonial office to send captain william hobson to claim sovereignty for great britain and negotiate a treaty with the māori 39 the treaty of waitangi was first signed in the bay of islands on 6 february 1840 40 in response to the new zealand company s attempts to establish an independent settlement in wellington 41 and french settlers purchasing land in akaroa 42 hobson declared british sovereignty over all of new zealand on 21 may 1840 even though copies of the treaty were still circulating throughout the country for māori to sign 43 with the signing of the treaty and declaration of sovereignty the number of immigrants particularly from the united kingdom began to increase 44 a meeting of european and māori inhabitants of hawke s bay province engraving 1863 new zealand still part of the colony of new south wales became a separate colony of new zealand on 1 july 1841 45 the colony gained a representative government in 1852 and the first parliament met in 1854 46 in 1856 the colony effectively became self-governing gaining responsibility over all domestic matters other than native policy 46 control over native policy was granted in the mid-1860s 46 following concerns that the south island might form a separate colony premier alfred domett moved a resolution to transfer the capital from auckland to a locality near the cook strait 47 wellington was chosen for its harbour and central location with parliament officially sitting there for the first time in 1865 as immigrant numbers increased conflicts over land led to the new zealand wars of the 1860s and 1870s resulting in the loss and confiscation of much māori land 48 in 1891 the liberal party led by john ballance came to power as the first organised political party the liberal government later led by richard seddon passed many important social and economic measures in 1893 new zealand was the first nation in the world to grant all women the right to vote 49 and in 1894 pioneered the adoption of compulsory arbitration between employers and unions 50 in 1898 seddon s government passed the old-age pensions act of 1898 the first general pensions scheme in the british empire in 1907 at the request of the new zealand parliament king edward vii proclaimed new zealand a dominion within the british empire reflecting its self-governing status accordingly the title dominion of new zealand dates from 1907 51 52 in 1947 the country adopted the statute of westminster confirming that the british parliament could no longer legislate for new zealand without the consent of new zealand 46 early in the 20th century new zealand was involved in world affairs fighting in the first and second world wars 53 and suffering through the great depression 54 the depression led to the election of the first labour government and the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state and a protectionist economy 55 new zealand experienced increasing prosperity following the second world war 56 and māori began to leave their traditional rural life and move to the cities in search of work 57 a māori protest movement developed which criticised eurocentrism and worked for greater recognition of māori culture and the treaty of waitangi 58 in 1975 a waitangi tribunal was set up to investigate alleged breaches of the treaty and it was enabled to investigate historic grievances in 1985 40 the government has negotiated settlements of these grievances with many iwi although māori claims to the foreshore and seabed have proved controversial in the 2000s politics main article politics of new zealand government elizabeth ii queen of new zealand since 1952 new zealand is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy 59 although its constitution is not codified 60 elizabeth ii is the queen of new zealand and the head of state 61 the queen is represented by the governor-general whom she appoints on the advice of the prime minister 62 63 the governor-general can exercise the crown s prerogative powers such as reviewing cases of injustice and making appointments of ministers ambassadors and other key public officials 64 and in rare situations the reserve powers e.g the power to dissolve parliament or refuse the royal assent of a bill into law 65 the powers of the queen and the governor-general are limited by constitutional constraints and they cannot normally be exercised without the advice of ministers 65 the new zealand parliament holds legislative power and consists of the queen and the house of representatives 66 it also included an upper house the legislative council until this was abolished in 1950 66 the supremacy of parliament over the crown and other government institutions was established in england by the bill of rights 1689 and has been ratified as law in new zealand 66 the house of representatives is democratically elected and a government is formed from the party or coalition with the majority of seats if no majority is formed a minority government can be formed if support from other parties during confidence and supply votes is assured 66 the governor-general appoints ministers under advice from the prime minister who is by convention the parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition 67 cabinet formed by ministers and led by the prime minister is the highest policy-making body in government and responsible for deciding significant government actions 68 members of cabinet make major decisions collectively and are therefore collectively responsible for the consequences of these decisions 69 bill english prime minister almost all parliamentary general elections between 1853 and 1993 were held under the first-past-the-post voting system 70 since the 1996 election a form of proportional representation called mixed member proportional mmp has been used 60 under the mmp system each person has two votes one is for electorate seats including some reserved for māori 71 and the other is for a party since the 2014 election there have been 71 electorates which includes 7 māori electorates and the remaining 49 seats are assigned so that representation in parliament reflects the party vote although a party has to win one electorate or 5 of the total party vote before it is eligible for these seats 72 elections since the 1930s have been dominated by two political parties national and labour 70 between march 2005 and august 2006 new zealand became the only country in the world in which all the highest offices in the land—head of state governor-general prime minister speaker and chief justice —were occupied simultaneously by women 73 the current prime minister is bill english

issues and new zealand s nuclear-free policy 87 88 despite the united states suspension of anzus obligations the treaty remained in effect between new zealand and australia whose foreign policy has followed a similar historical trend 89 close political contact is maintained between the two countries with free trade agreements and travel arrangements that allow citizens to visit live and work in both countries without restrictions 90 in 2013 update there were about 650,000 new zealand citizens living in australia which is equivalent to 15 of the population of new zealand 91 new zealand has a strong presence among the pacific island countries a large proportion of new zealand s aid goes to these countries and many pacific people migrate to new zealand for employment 92 permanent migration

the early european settlers divided new zealand into provinces which had a degree of autonomy 112 because of financial pressures and the desire to consolidate railways education land sales and other policies government was centralised and the provinces were abolished in 1876 113 the provinces are remembered in regional public holidays 114 and sporting rivalries 115 since 1876 various councils have administered local areas under legislation determined by the central government 112 116 in 1989 the government reorganised local government into the current two-tier structure of regional councils and territorial authorities 117 the 249 municipalities 117 that existed in 1975 have now been consolidated into 67 territorial authorities and 11 regional councils 118 the regional councils role is to regulate the natural environment with particular emphasis on resource management 117 while territorial authorities are responsible for sewage water local roads building consents and other local matters 119 120 five of the territorial councils are unitary authorities and also act as regional councils 120 the territorial authorities consist of 13 city councils 53 district councils and

glaciation of this south-western corner of the south island 138 the north island is the 14th largest island in the world and is less mountainous but is marked by volcanism 139 the highly active taupo volcanic zone has formed a large volcanic plateau punctuated by the north island s highest mountain mount ruapehu 2,797 metres 9,177 ft the plateau also hosts the country s largest lake lake taupo 140 nestled in the caldera of one of the world s most active supervolcanoes 141 the country owes its varied topography and perhaps even its emergence above the waves to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the pacific and indo-australian plates 142 new zealand is part of zealandia a microcontinent nearly half the size of australia that gradually submerged after breaking away from the gondwanan supercontinent 143 about 25 million years ago a shift in plate tectonic movements began to contort and crumple the region this is now most evident in the southern alps formed by compression of the crust beside the alpine fault elsewhere the plate boundary involves the subduction of one plate under the other producing the puysegur trench to the south the hikurangi trench east of the north island and the kermadec and tonga trenches 144 further north 142 new zealand is part of australasia and oceania the term oceania is often used to denote the region encompassing the australian continent new

biogeography has influenced evolution of the country s species of animals fungi and plants physical isolation has not caused biological isolation and this has resulted in a dynamic evolutionary ecology with examples of very distinctive plants and animals as well as populations of widespread species 154 155 about 82 of new zealand s indigenous vascular plants are endemic covering 1,944 species across 65 genera and includes a single endemic family 156 157 the number of fungi recorded from new zealand including lichen-forming species is not known nor is the proportion of those fungi which are endemic but one estimate suggests there are about 2,300 species of lichen-forming fungi in new zealand 156 and 40 of these are endemic 158 the two main types of forest are those dominated by broadleaf trees with emergent podocarps or by southern beech in cooler climates 159 the remaining vegetation types consist of grasslands the majority of which are tussock 160 before the arrival of humans an estimated 80 of the land was covered in forest with only high alpine wet infertile and volcanic areas without trees 161 massive deforestation occurred after humans arrived with around half the forest cover lost to fire after polynesian settlement 162 much of the remaining forest fell after european settlement being logged or cleared to make room for pastoral farming leaving forest occupying only 23 of the land 163 the extinct moa megalapteryx didinus the forests were dominated by birds and the lack of mammalian predators led to some like the kiwi kakapo weka and takahē evolving flightlessness 164 the arrival of humans associated changes to habitat and the introduction of rats ferrets and other mammals led to the extinction of many bird species including large birds like the

gold kauri gum and native timber 181 with the development of refrigerated shipping in the 1880s meat and dairy products were exported to britain a trade which provided the basis for strong economic growth in new zealand 182 high demand for agricultural products from the united kingdom and the united states helped new zealanders achieve higher living standards than both australia and western
