located in the heart of the mediterranean sea italy shares open land borders with france switzerland austria slovenia san marino and vatican city italy covers an area of 301,338 km 2 116,347 sq mi and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and mediterranean climate due to its shape it is often referred to in italy as lo stivale the boot 12 13 with 61 million inhabitants it is the fourth most populous eu member state since classical times ancient carthaginians phoenicians and greeks established settlements in the south of italy with etruscans and celts inhabiting the centre and north of italy respectively and various different ancient italian tribes and italic peoples dispersed throughout the italian peninsula and insular italy the italic tribe known as the latins formed the roman kingdom which eventually became a republic that conquered and assimilated other nearby civilisations rome ultimately emerged as the dominant power in the mediterranean basin conquering much of the ancient world and becoming the leading cultural political and religious centre of western civilisation the legacy of the roman empire is widespread and can be observed in the global distribution of civilian law republican governments christianity and the latin script during the middle ages italy suffered sociopolitical collapse amid calamitous barbarian invasions but by the 11th century numerous rival city-states and maritime republics rose to great prosperity through shipping commerce and banking laying down the groundwork for modern capitalism 14 these independent statelets acting as europe s main trading hubs with asia and the near east often enjoyed a greater degree of democracy and wealth in comparison to the larger feudal monarchies that were consolidating throughout europe at the time though much of central italy remained under the control of the theocratic papal states while southern italy remained largely feudal until the 19th century partially as a result of a succession of byzantine arab norman spanish and bourbon conquests of the region 15 the renaissance began in italy and spread to the rest of europe bringing a renewed interest in humanism science exploration and art italian culture flourished at this time producing famous scholars artists and polymaths such as leonardo da vinci galileo michelangelo and machiavelli italian explorers such as marco polo christopher columbus amerigo vespucci and giovanni da verrazzano discovered new routes to the far east and the new world helping to usher in the european age of discovery nevertheless italy s commercial and political power significantly waned with the opening of the atlantic trade route and the route to the indian ocean via the cape of good hope that bypassed the mediterranean 15 16 17 furthermore the italian city-states constantly engaged one another in bloody warfare culminating in the italian wars of the 15th and 16th centuries that left them exhausted with no one emerging as a dominant power the weakened sovereigns soon fell victim to conquest by european powers such as france spain and austria subsequently entering a long period of decline by the mid-19th century a rising movement in support of italian nationalism and independence from foreign control led to a period of revolutionary political upheaval known as the risorgimento which sought the formation of a unified nation-state after various unsuccessful attempts the italian wars of independence and the expedition of the thousand resulted in the eventual unification of the country in 1861 now a great power after centuries of foreign domination and political division 18 from the late 19th century to the early 20th century the new kingdom of italy rapidly industrialised although mainly in the north and acquired a colonial empire 19 while the south remained largely impoverished and excluded from industrialisation fuelling a large and influential diaspora 20 despite being one of the main victors in world war i italy entered a period of economic crisis and social turmoil leading the way to the rise of a fascist dictatorship in 1922 the subsequent participation in world war ii on the axis side ended in military defeat economic destruction and an italian civil war following the liberation of italy and the rise of the resistance the country abolished the monarchy reinstated democracy enjoyed a prolonged economic boom and despite periods of sociopolitical turmoil e.g anni di piombo mani pulite the second mafia war the maxi trial and subsequent assassinations of anti-mafia officials became a major

etymology main article name of italy the assumptions on the etymology of the name italia are very numerous and the corpus of the solutions proposed by historians and linguists is very wide 28 according to one of the more common explanations the term italia from latin italia 29 was borrowed through greek from the oscan víteliú meaning land of young cattle cf lat vitulus calf umb vitlo calf 30 the bull was a symbol of the southern italic tribes and was often depicted goring the roman wolf as a defiant symbol of free italy during the social war greek historian dionysius of halicarnassus states this account together with the legend that italy was named after italus 31 mentioned also by aristotle 32 and thucydides 33 the name italia originally applied only to a part of what is now southern italy – according to antiochus of syracuse the southern portion of the bruttium peninsula modern calabria province of reggio and part of the provinces of catanzaro and vibo valentia but by his time oenotria and italy had become synonymous and the name also applied to most of lucania as well the greeks gradually came to apply the name italia to a larger region but it was during the reign of emperor augustus end of the 1st century bc that the term was expanded to cover the entire peninsula until the alps 34 history main article history of italy prehistory and antiquity main articles prehistoric italy nuragic civilisation etruscan civilisation magna graecia and ancient rome the colosseum in rome built c 70 – 80 ad is considered one of the greatest works of architecture and engineering of ancient history excavations throughout italy revealed a neanderthal presence dating back to the palaeolithic period some 200,000 years ago 35 modern humans arrived about 40,000 years ago the ancient peoples of pre-roman italy – such as the umbrians the latins from which the romans emerged volsci oscans samnites sabines the celts the ligures and many others – were indo-european peoples the main historic peoples of possible non-indo-european heritage include the etruscans the elymians and sicani in sicily and the prehistoric sardinians which includes the nuragic civilisation other ancient italian peoples of undetermined language families but of possible non-indo-european origins include the rhaetian people and cammuni known for their rock carvings between the 17th and the 11th centuries bc mycenaean greeks established contacts with italy 36 37 38 39 and in the 8th and 7th centuries bc greek colonies were established all along the coast of sicily and the southern part of the italian peninsula became known as magna graecia also the phoenicians established colonies on the coasts of sardinia and sicily rome a settlement around a ford on the river tiber conventionally founded in 753 bc grew over the course of centuries into a massive empire stretching from britain to the borders of persia and engulfing the whole mediterranean basin in which greek and roman and many other cultures merged into a unique civilisation the roman legacy has deeply influenced the western civilisation shaping most of the modern world 40 in a slow decline since the third century ad the empire split in two in 395 ad the western empire under the pressure of the barbarian invasions eventually dissolved in 476 ad when its last emperor was deposed by the germanic chief odoacer while the

built by german emperor frederick ii now a unesco world heritage site after the fall of the western roman empire italy was seized by the ostrogoths 41 followed in the 6th century by a brief reconquest under byzantine emperor justinian the invasion of another germanic tribe the lombards late in the same century reduced the byzantine presence to a rump realm the exarchate of ravenna and started the end of political unity of the peninsula for the next 1,300 years the lombard kingdom was subsequently absorbed into the frankish empire by charlemagne in the late 8th century the franks also helped the formation of the papal states in central italy until the 13th century italian politics was dominated by the relations between the holy roman emperors and the papacy with most of the italian city-states siding for the former ghibellines or for the latter guelphs from momentary convenience 42 it was during this chaotic era that italian towns saw the rise of a peculiar institution the medieval commune given the power vacuum caused by extreme territorial fragmentation and the struggle between the empire and the holy see local communities sought autonomous ways to maintain law and order 43 in 1176 a league of city-states the lombard league defeated the german emperor frederick barbarossa at the battle of legnano thus ensuring effective independence for most of northern and central italian cities in coastal and southern areas the maritime republics the most notable being venice genoa pisa and amalfi heavily involved in the crusades grew to eventually dominate the mediterranean and monopolise trade routes to the orient 44 in the south sicily had become an islamic emirate in the 9th century thriving until the italo-normans conquered it in the late 11th century together with most of the lombard and byzantine principalities of southern italy 45 through a complex series of events southern italy developed as a unified kingdom first under the house of hohenstaufen then under the capetian house of anjou and from the 15th century the house of aragon in sardinia the former byzantine provinces became independent states known as giudicati although some parts of the island were under genoese or pisan control until the aragonese conquered it in the 15th century the black death pandemic of 1348 left its mark on italy by killing perhaps one third of the population 46 47 however the recovery from the plague led to a resurgence of cities trade and economy which allowed the bloom of humanism and renaissance that later spread in europe early modern leonardo da vinci the quintessential renaissance man self portrait c 1512 the painting is kept in the biblioteca reale of turin christopher columbus discovered america in 1492 opening a new era in the history of humankind in the 14th and 15th centuries northern-central italy was divided into a number of warring city-states the rest of the peninsula being occupied by the larger papal states and the kingdom of sicily referred to here as naples though many of these city-states were often formally subordinate to foreign rulers as in the case of the duchy of milan which was officially a constituent state of the mainly germanic holy roman empire the city-states generally managed to maintain de facto independence from the foreign sovereigns that had seized italian lands following the collapse of the western roman empire the strongest among these city-states gradually absorbed the surrounding territories giving birth to the signorie regional states often led by merchant families which founded local dynasties war between the city-states was endemic and primarily fought by armies of mercenaries known as condottieri bands of soldiers drawn from around europe especially germany and switzerland led largely by italian captains 48 decades of fighting eventually saw florence milan and venice emerged as the dominant players that agreed to the peace of lodi in 1454 which saw relative calm brought to the region for the first time in centuries this peace would hold for the next forty years the renaissance a period of vigorous revival of the arts and culture originated in italy thanks to a number of factors as the great wealth accumulated by merchant cities the patronage of its dominant families like the medici of florence 49 50 and the migration of greek scholars and texts to italy following the conquest of constantinople at the hands of the ottoman turks 51 52 53 the italian renaissance peaked in the mid-16th century as foreign invasions plunged the region into the turmoil of the italian wars the ideas and ideals of the renaissance soon spread into northern europe france england and much of europe in the meantime the discovery of the americas the new routes to asia discovered by the portuguese and the rise of the ottoman empire all factors which eroded the traditional italian dominance in trade with the east caused a long economic decline in the peninsula following the italian wars 1494 to 1559 ignited by the rivalry between france and spain the city-states gradually lost their independence and came under foreign domination first under spain 1559 to 1713 and then austria 1713 to 1796 in 1629–1631 a new outburst of plague claimed about 14 of italy s population 54 in addition as the spanish empire started to decline in the 17th century so did its possessions in naples sicily sardinia and milan in particular southern italy was impoverished and cut off from the mainstream of events in europe 55 in the 18th century as a result of the war of spanish succession austria replaced spain as the dominant foreign power while the house of savoy emerged as a regional power expanding to piedmont and sardinia in the same century the two-century long decline was interrupted by the economic and state reforms pursued in several states by the ruling élites 56 during the napoleonic wars northern-central italy was invaded and reorganised as a new kingdom of italy a client state of the french empire 57 while the southern half of the peninsula was administered by joachim murat napoleon s brother-in-law who was crowned as king of naples the 1814 congress of vienna restored the

nationalists and monarchists loyal to the house of savoy to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire italian peninsula in the context of the 1848 liberal revolutions that swept through europe an unsuccessful war was declared on austria the kingdom of sardinia again attacked the austrian empire in the second italian war of independence of 1859 with the aid of france resulting in liberating lombardy in 1860–61 general giuseppe garibaldi led the drive for unification in naples and sicily 58 allowing the sardinian government led by the count of cavour to declare a united italian kingdom on 17 march 1861 in 1866 victor emmanuel ii allied with prussia during the austro-prussian war waging the third italian war of independence which allowed italy to annex venetia finally as france during the disastrous franco-prussian war of 1870 abandoned its garrisons in rome the italians rushed to fill the power gap by taking over the papal states the constitutional law of the kingdom of sardinia the albertine statute of 1848 was extended to the whole kingdom of italy in 1861 and provided for basic freedoms of the new state but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting the government of the new kingdom took place in a framework of parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberal forces in 1913 male universal suffrage was adopted as northern italy quickly industrialised the south and rural areas of north remained underdeveloped and overpopulated forcing millions of people to migrate abroad while the italian socialist party constantly increased in strength challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment starting from the last two decades of the 19th century italy developed into a colonial power by forcing somalia eritrea and later libya and the dodecanese under its rule 59 italy nominally allied with the german empire and the empire of austria-hungary in the triple alliance in 1915 joined the allies into the war with a promise of substantial territorial gains that included western inner carniola former austrian littoral dalmatia as well as parts of the ottoman empire the war was initially inconclusive as the italian army get struck in a long attrition war in the alps making little progress and suffering very heavy losses eventually in october 1918 the italians launched a massive offensive culminating in the victory of vittorio veneto the italian victory 60 61 62 marked the end of the war on the italian front secured the dissolution of the austro-hungarian empire and

bankruptcy under the peace treaties of saint-germain rapallo and rome italy obtained most of the promised territories but not dalmatia except zara allowing nationalists to define the victory as mutilated moreover italy annexed the hungarian harbour of fiume that was not part of territories promised at london but had been occupied after the end of the war by gabriele d annunzio fascist regime main articles italian fascism and military history of italy during world war ii benito mussolini duce of fascist italy the socialist agitations that followed the devastation of the great war inspired by the russian revolution led to counter-revolution and repression throughout italy the liberal establishment fearing a soviet-style revolution started to endorse the small national fascist party led by benito mussolini in october 1922 the blackshirts of the national fascist party attempted a coup the march on rome which failed but at the last minute king victor emmanuel iii refused to proclaim a state of siege and appointed mussolini prime minister over the next few years mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties thus forming a dictatorship these actions attracted international attention and eventually inspired similar dictatorships such as nazi germany and francoist spain in 1935 mussolini invaded ethiopia resulting in an international alienation and leading to italy s withdrawal from the league of nations italy allied with nazi germany and the empire of japan and strongly supported francisco franco in the spanish civil war in 1939 italy annexed albania a de facto protectorate for decades italy entered world war ii on 10 june 1940 after initially advancing in british somaliland and egypt the italians were defeated in east africa greece russia and north africa after the attack on yugoslavia by germany and italy suppression of the yugoslav partisans resistance and attempts to italianisation resulted in the italian war crimes 64 and deportation of about 25,000 people to the italian concentration camps such as rab gonars monigo renicci di anghiari and elsewhere after the war due to the cold war a long period of censorship disinterest and denial occurred about the italian war crimes and the yugoslav s foibe killings 65 66 67 68 meanwhile about 250,000 italians and anti-communist slavs fled to italy in the istrian exodus an allied invasion of sicily began in july 1943 leading to the collapse of the fascist regime and the fall of mussolini on 25 july on 8 september italy surrendered the germans shortly succeeded in taking control of northern and central italy the country remained a battlefield for the rest of the war as the allies were slowly moving up from the south in the north the germans set up the italian social republic rsi a nazi puppet state with mussolini installed as leader the post-armistice period saw the rise of a large anti-fascist resistance movement the resistenza hostilities ended on 29

remained however the main government party during craxi s government the economy recovered and italy became the world s fifth largest industrial nation gaining entry into the g7 group however as a result of his spending policies the italian national debt skyrocketed during the craxi era soon passing 100 of the gdp in the early 1990s italy faced significant challenges as voters – disenchanted with political paralysis massive public debt and the extensive corruption system known as tangentopoli uncovered by the clean hands investigation – demanded radical reforms the scandals involved all

dioxide emissions in the 1990s 86 italy is the twelfth largest carbon dioxide producer 87 88 extensive traffic and congestion in the largest metropolitan areas continue to cause severe environmental and health issues even if smog levels have decreased dramatically since the 1970s and 1980s and the presence of smog is becoming an increasingly rarer phenomenon and levels of sulphur dioxide are decreasing 89 many watercourses and coastal stretches have also been contaminated by industrial and agricultural activity while because of rising water levels venice has been regularly flooded throughout recent years waste from industrial activity is not always disposed of by legal means and has led to permanent health effects on inhabitants of affected areas as in the case of the seveso disaster the country has also operated several nuclear reactors between 1963 and 1990 but after the chernobyl disaster and a referendum on the issue the nuclear programme was terminated a decision that was overturned by the government in 2008 planning to build up to four nuclear power plants with french technology this was in turn struck down by a referendum following the fukushima nuclear
