it is known in colloquial shorthand began as an organization largely built around one man kettering it eventually evolved into a more modern organization whose path is shaped by individuals but not dominated entirely by any of them world war ii was a turning point wherein military affairs after mingling with the technologies of applied science for some 80 years first started to become fundamentally reinvented by them civilian life too changed in this direction by the 1950s corporations such as gm and many others were facing a new era of r d different from earlier ones less about genius inventors and individual inventions and more about organizational progress and integrated systems it raised new questions about where the capital for r d would come from in an era of limitless demand for r d although not necessarily for production alfred sloan longtime ceo of gm 1920s to 1960s discussed in his memoir also considered a seminal management treatise the relationships between

production as the chevrolet aveo uk and the chevrolet sonic us from the 1920s onward general motors always maintained an internal dialog about what its economy-car and small-car policies should be 99 100 the economy and size considerations often naturally overlapped although a strong distinction was always drawn in the 20th century between policies for the u.s market and policies for other markets economy in some form always had good demand anywhere but its definition in the u.s was long considered different from that in other markets in this view economy in the u.s did not mean small in the sense of what qualified as small outside the u.s the policy discussion often focused on topics like the higher demand for truly small cars in non-u.s markets than in the u.s. and whether it made more sense to import a car into a certain country or to build it domestically within that country either as some variant of knockdown or with truly extensive domestic sourcing 99 gm s acquisitions of vauxhall motors ltd uk 1925 99 and adam opel ag germany 1929 99 rather than starting new domestic companies to compete against them were based on analyses that convinced gm managers that acquiring an existing domestic manufacturer was a better business decision 99 although gm since the 1920s has always offered economy models in the u.s market relative to that market s definition in any given decade and had done research and development in the 1940s and 1950s in preparation for any potential rise of strong demand for truly small cars in the u.s market 100 it has also been criticized over the decades for not doing enough to promote fuel efficiency in the u.s market in the 1970s through 1990s gm s response has been that it has always responded to market demands and that most americans despite anything they said to the contrary did not actually demand at purchasing-decision time small size or fuel efficiency in their vehicles to any great or lasting extent although some u.s consumers flocked temporarily to the ideal of fuel economy whenever fuel supply crises arose such as 1973 and 1979 they flocked equally enthusiastically to suvs when cheap fuel of the 1980s and 1990s temporarily shielded them from any downside to these choices citation needed since the return of high fuel prices in the 2000s and 2010s gm s interest in truly small-car programs for the u.s market

corvair edit 1961-63 corvair swing-axle rear suspension unsafe at any speed by ralph nader published in 1965 is a pioneering book accusing car manufacturers of being slow to introduce safety features and reluctant to spend money on improving safety the subject for which the book is probably most widely known the rear-engined gm chevrolet corvair is covered in the first chapter it relates to the first 1960–1964 models that had a swing-axle suspension design which was prone to tuck under in certain circumstances in substitution for the cost-cutting lack of a front stabilizer bar anti-roll bar corvairs required tire pressures which were outside of the tire manufacturer s recommended tolerances the corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential 15psi front 26psi rear when cold 18 psi and 30psi hot and if one inflated the tires equally as was standard practice for all other cars at the time the result was a dangerous oversteer 159 in early march 1966 several media outlets including the new republic and the new york times reported that gm had tried to discredit ralph nader hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations 160 161 nader sued the company for invasion of privacy and settled the case for 425,000 nader s lawsuit against gm was ultimately decided by the new york court of appeals whose opinion in the case expanded tort law to cover overzealous surveillance 162 nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the pro-consumer center for study of responsive law a 1972 safety commission report conducted by texas a m university concluded that the 1960–1963 corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations 163 the u.s department of transportation dot issued a press release in 1972 describing the findings of nhtsa testing from the previous year nhtsa had conducted a series of comparative tests in 1971 studying the handling of the 1963 corvair and four contemporary cars—a ford falcon plymouth valiant volkswagen beetle and renault dauphine —along with a second-generation corvair with its completely redesigned independent rear suspension the 143-page report reviewed nhtsa s extreme-condition handling tests national crash-involvement data for the cars in the test as well as general motors internal documentation regarding the corvair s handling 164 nhtsa went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests this review panel concluded that the 1960–63 corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests the handling and stability performance of the 1960–63 corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic former gm executive john delorean asserted in his book on a clear day you can see general motors that nader s criticisms were valid 165 journalist david e davis in a 2009 article in automobile magazine noted that despite nader s claim that swing-axle rear suspension were dangerous porsche mercedes-benz and volkswagen all used similar swing-axle concepts during that era 166 defective ignition system investigation edit main article general motors
