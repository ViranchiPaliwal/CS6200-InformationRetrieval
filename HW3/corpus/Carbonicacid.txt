given to solutions of carbon dioxide in water carbonated water because such solutions contain small amounts of h 2 co 3 in physiology carbonic acid is described as volatile acid or respiratory acid because it is the only acid excreted as a gas by the lungs 2 it plays an important role in the bicarbonate buffer system to maintain acid–base homeostasis carbonic acid which is a weak acid forms two kinds of salts the carbonates and the bicarbonates in geology carbonic acid causes limestone to dissolve producing calcium bicarbonate which leads to many limestone features such as stalactites and stalagmites it was long believed that carbonic acid could not exist as a pure compound however in 1991 it was reported that nasa scientists had succeeded in making solid h 2 co 3 samples 3 chemical equilibrium edit when carbon dioxide dissolves in water it exists in chemical equilibrium producing carbonic acid 4 co 2 h 2 o ⇌ h 2 co 3 the hydration equilibrium constant at 25 °c is called k h which in the case of carbonic acid is h 2 co 3 co 2 ≈ 1.7×10 −3 in pure water 5 and ≈ 1.2×10 −3 in seawater 6 hence the majority of the carbon dioxide is not converted into carbonic acid remaining as co 2 molecules in the absence of a catalyst the equilibrium is reached quite slowly the rate constants are 0.039 s −1 for the forward reaction co 2  h 2 o → h 2 co 3 and 23 s −1 for the reverse reaction h 2 co 3 → co 2 h 2 o the addition of two molecules of water to co 2 would give orthocarbonic acid c oh 4 which exists only in minute amounts in aqueous solution addition of base to an excess of carbonic acid gives bicarbonate hydrogen carbonate with excess base carbonic acid reacts to give carbonate salts role of carbonic acid in blood edit bicarbonate is an intermediate in the transport of co 2 out of the body via respiratory gas exchange the hydration reaction of co 2 is generally very slow in the absence of a catalyst but red blood cells contain carbonic anhydrase which increases the reaction rate producing bicarbonate hco 3 − dissolved in the blood plasma this catalysed reaction is reversed in the lungs where it converts the bicarbonate back into co 2 and allows it to be expelled this equilibration plays an important role as a buffer in mammalian blood 7 a 2016 theoretical report suggests that carbonic acid may play a pivotal role in protonating various nitrogen bases in blood serum 8 role of carbonic acid in ocean chemistry edit the oceans of the world have absorbed almost half of the co 2 emitted by humans from the burning of fossil fuels 9 it has been theorized that the extra dissolved carbon dioxide has caused the ocean s average surface ph to shift by about −0.1 unit from pre-industrial levels this theory is known as ocean acidification even though the ocean remains basic 10 acidity of carbonic acid edit carbonic acid is a polyprotic acid — specifically it is diprotic meaning it has two protons which may dissociate from the parent molecule thus there are two dissociation constants the first one for the dissociation into the bicarbonate also called hydrogen carbonate ion hco 3 − h 2 co 3 ⇌ hco 3 − h k a1 2.5×10 −4 4 p k a1 3.6 at 25 °c care must be taken when quoting and using the first dissociation constant of carbonic acid in aqueous solution carbonic acid exists in equilibrium with carbon dioxide and the concentration of h 2 co 3 is much lower than the concentration of co 2 in many analyses h 2 co 3 includes dissolved co 2 referred to as co 2 aq h 2 co 3 is used to represent the two species when writing the aqueous chemical equilibrium equation the equation may be rewritten as follows 4 h 2 co 3 ⇌ hco 3 − h k a app 4.47×10 −7 p k app 6.35 at 25 °c and ionic strength 0.0 whereas this apparent p k a is quoted as the dissociation constant of carbonic acid it is ambiguous it might better be referred to as the acidity constant of dissolved carbon dioxide as it is particularly useful for calculating the ph of co 2 containing solutions a similar situation applies to sulfurous acid h 2 so 3 which exists in equilibrium with substantial amounts of unhydrated sulfur dioxide the second constant is for the dissociation of the bicarbonate ion into the carbonate ion co 3 2− hco 3 − ⇌ co 3 2− h k a2 4.69×10 −11 p k a2 10.329 at 25 °c and ionic strength 0.0 the three acidity constants are defined as follows

pure co 2 solution is completely determined by the partial pressure p co 2 displaystyle p text co 2 of carbon dioxide above the solution to calculate this composition account must be taken of the above equilibria between the three different carbonate forms h 2 co 3 hco 3 − and co 3 2− as well as of the hydration equilibrium between dissolved co 2 and h 2 co 3 with constant k h h 2 co 3 co 2

largely lower than pka 2 so that the co 3 2− concentration is always negligible with respect to hco 3 − concentration in fact co 3 2− plays no quantitative role in the present calculation see remark below for vanishing p co 2 displaystyle p text co 2 the ph is close to the one of pure water ph 7 and the dissolved carbon is essentially in the hco 3 − form for normal atmospheric conditions p co 2 3.5 × 10 − 4 displaystyle p text co 2 3.5 times 10 -4 atm we get a slightly acid solution ph 5.7 and the dissolved carbon is now essentially in the co 2 form from this pressure on oh − becomes also negligible so that the ionized part of the solution is now an equimolar mixture of h and hco 3 − for a co 2 pressure typical of the one in carbonated drink bottles p co 2 displaystyle p text co 2 2.5 atm we get a relatively acid medium ph 3.7 with a high concentration of dissolved co 2 these features contribute to the sour and sparkling taste of these drinks between 2.5 and 10 atm the ph crosses the pka 1 value 3.60 giving a dominant h 2 co 3 concentration with respect to hco 3 − at high pressures a plot of the equilibrium concentrations of these different forms of dissolved inorganic carbon and which species is dominant as a function of the ph of the solution is known as a bjerrum plot remark as noted above co 3 2− may be neglected for this specific problem resulting in the following

believed that carbonic acid could not exist as a pure compound however in 1991 scientists at nasa s goddard space flight center usa succeeded in making solid h 2 co 3 samples 3 they did so by exposing a frozen mixture of water and carbon dioxide to high-energy proton radiation and then warming to remove the excess water the carbonic acid that remained was characterized by infrared spectroscopy the fact that the carbonic acid was prepared by irradiating a solid h 2 o co 2 mixture or even by irradiation of dry ice alone has given rise to suggestions that h 2 co 3 might be found in outer space or on mars where frozen ices of h 2 o and co 2 are found as well as cosmic rays 11 12 it was announced in 1993 that solid carbonic acid had been created by a cryogenic reaction of potassium bicarbonate and hcl dissolved in methanol 13 14 later work showed that in fact the methyl ester had been formed but other methods were successful 12 theoretical calculations showed that a single molecule of water can catalyze the decomposition of a gas-phase carbonic acid molecule to carbon dioxide and water in the absence of water the dissociation of gaseous carbonic acid has been predicted to be very slow with a half-life of 180,000 years 11 this only applies if the molecules are few and far between because it has also been predicted that gas-phase carbonic acid will catalyze its own decomposition by forming dimers which then break apart into two molecules each of water and carbon dioxide 15 for a while it was thought that there were two polymorphs of solid carbonic acid called α and β the polymorph denoted beta carbonic acid was prepared by heating alternating layers of glassy aqueous solutions of bicarbonate and acid in vacuum which causes protonation of the bicarbonate followed by removal of the solvent the previously suggested alpha carbonic acid which was prepared by the same technique using methanol rather than water as a solvent was later shown to be a monomethyl ester ch 3
