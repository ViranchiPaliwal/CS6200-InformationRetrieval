mississippian culture developed advanced agriculture grand architecture and state-level societies 58 after the spanish conquistadors made the first contacts the native population declined for various reasons primarily from diseases such as smallpox and measles violence was not a significant factor in the overall decline among native americans though conflict among themselves and with europeans
