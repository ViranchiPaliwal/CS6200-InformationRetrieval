template message energy subsidies are measures that keep prices for consumers below market levels or for producers above market levels or reduce costs for consumers and producers 1 energy subsidies may be direct cash transfers to producers consumers or related bodies as well as indirect support mechanisms such as tax exemptions and rebates price controls trade restrictions and limits on market access they may also include energy conservation subsidies 2 the development of today s major modern energy industries have all relied on substantial subsidy support global fossil fuel subsidies represented 6.5 of global gdp in 2015 3 the elimination of these subsidies is widely seen as one of the most effective ways of reducing global carbon emissions 3 4 5 overview edit main arguments for energy subsidies are security of supply – subsidies are used to ensure adequate domestic supply by supporting indigenous fuel production in order to reduce import dependency or supporting overseas activities of national energy companies environmental improvement – subsidies are used to reduce pollution including different emissions and to fulfill international obligations e.g kyoto protocol economic benefits – subsidies in the form of reduced prices are used to stimulate particular economic sectors or segments of the population e.g alleviating poverty and increasing access to energy in developing countries employment and social benefits – subsidies are used to maintain employment especially in periods of economic transition 6 main arguments against energy subsidies are some energy subsidies counter the goal of sustainable development as they may lead to higher consumption and waste exacerbating the harmful effects of energy use on the environment create a heavy burden on government finances and weaken the potential for economies to grow undermine private and public investment in the energy sector 7 also most benefits from fossil fuel subsidies in developing countries go to the richest 20 of households 8 impede the expansion of distribution networks and the development of more environmentally benign energy technologies and do not always help the people that need them most 7 the study conducted by the world bank finds that subsidies to the large commercial businesses that dominate the energy sector are not justified however under some circumstances it is reasonable to use subsidies to promote access to energy for the poorest households in developing countries energy subsidies should encourage access to the modern energy sources not to cover operating costs of companies 9 the study conducted by the world resources institute finds that energy subsidies often go to capital intensive projects at the expense of smaller or distributed alternatives 10 types of energy subsidies are direct financial transfers – grants to producers grants to consumers low-interest or preferential loans to producers preferential tax treatments – rebates or exemption on royalties duties producer levies and tariffs tax credit accelerated depreciation allowances on energy supply equipment trade restrictions – quota technical restrictions and trade embargoes energy-related services provided by government at less than full cost – direct investment in energy infrastructure public research and development regulation of the energy sector – demand guarantees and mandated deployment rates price controls market-access restrictions preferential planning consent and controls over access to resources failure to impose external costs – environmental externality costs energy security risks and price volatility costs 7 depletion allowance – allows a deduction from gross income of up to 27 for the depletion of exhaustible resources oil gas minerals overall energy subsidies require coordination and integrated implementation especially in light of globalization and increased interconnectedness of energy policies thus their regulation at the world trade organization is often seen as necessary 11 12 impact of fossil fuel subsidies edit a 2016 study estimated that global fossil fuel subsidies were 5.3 trillion in 2015 which represents 6.5 of global gdp 3 the study found that china was the biggest subsidizer in 2013 1.8 trillion followed by the united states 0.6 trillion and russia the european union and india each with about 0.3 trillion 3 the authors estimated that the elimination of subsidies would have reduced global carbon emissions in 2013 by 21 and fossil fuel air pollution deaths 55 while raising revenue of 4 and social welfare by 2.2 of global gdp 3 according to the international energy agency the elimination of fossil fuel subsidies worldwide would be the one of the most effective ways of reducing greenhouse gases and battling global warming 4 in may 2016 the g7 nations set for the first time a deadline for ending most fossil fuel subsidies saying government support for coal oil and gas should end by 2025 13 according to the oecd subsidies supporting fossil fuels particularly coal and oil represent greater threats to the environment than subsidies to renewable energy subsidies to nuclear power contribute to unique environmental and safety issues related mostly to the risk of high-level environmental damage although nuclear power contributes positively to the environment in the areas of air pollution and climate change 14 according to fatih birol chief economist at the international energy agency without a phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies countries will not reach their climate targets 15 a 2010 study by global subsidies initiative compared global relative subsidies of different energy sources results show that fossil fuels receive 0.8 us cents per kwh of energy they produce although it should be noted that the estimate of fossil fuel subsidies applies only to consumer subsidies and only within non-oecd countries nuclear energy receives 1.7 cents kwh renewable energy excluding hydroelectricity receives 5.0 cents kwh and biofuels receive 5.1 cents kwh in subsidies 16 in 2011 iea chief economist faith birol said the current 409 billion equivalent of fossil fuel subsidies are encouraging a wasteful use of energy and that the cuts in subsidies is the biggest policy item that would help renewable energies get more market share and reduce co 2 emissions 17 impact of renewable energy subsidies edit global renewable energy subsidies reached 88 billion in 2011 18 according to the oecd subsidies to renewable energy are generally considered more environmentally beneficial than fossil fuel subsidies although the full range of environmental effects should to be taken into account 14 iea position on subsidies edit according to international energy agency iea 2011 energy subsidies artificially lower the price of energy paid by consumers raise the price received by producers or lower the cost of production fossil fuels subsidies costs generally outweigh the benefits subsidies to renewables and low-carbon energy technologies can bring long-term economic and environmental benefits 19 in november 2011 an iea report entitled deploying renewables 2011 said subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified in order to give an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits the iea s report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand a portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support the iea said and added that cost reductions in critical technologies such as wind and solar are set to continue 20 fossil-fuel consumption subsidies were 409 billion in 2010 oil products being half of it renewable-energy subsidies were 66 billion in 2010 and will reach 250 billion by 2035 according to iea renewable energy is subsidized in order to compete in the market increase their volume and develop the technology so that the subsidies become unnecessary with the development eliminating fossil-fuel subsidies could bring economic and environmental benefits phasing out fossil-fuel subsidies by 2020 would cut primary energy demand 5 since the start of 2010 at least 15 countries have taken steps to phase out fossil-fuel subsidies according to iea onshore wind may become competitive around 2020 in the european union 19 according to the iea the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies over 500 billion annually will reduce 10 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 21 subsidies by country edit the international energy agency estimates that governments subsidised fossil fuels by us 548 billion in 2013 22 ten countries accounted for almost three-quarters of this figure 23 at their meeting in september 2009 the g-20 countries committed to rationalize and phase out over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption 24 the 2010s have seen many countries reducing energy subsidies for instance in july 2014 ghana abolished all diesel and gasoline subsidies whilst in the same month egypt raised diesel prices 63 as part of a raft of reforms intended to remove subsidies within 5 years 25 the public energy subsidies for energy in finland in 2013 were €700 million for fossil energy and €60 million for renewable energy mainly wood and wind 26 united states edit allocation of subsidies in the united states edit on march 13 2013 terry m dinan senior advisor at the congressional budget office testified before the subcommittee on energy of the committee on science space and technology in the u.s house of representatives that federal energy tax subsidies would cost 16.4 billion that fiscal year broken down as follows renewable energy 7.3 billion 45 percent energy efficiency 4.8 billion 29 percent fossil fuels 3.2 billion 20 percent nuclear energy 1.1 billion 7 percent in addition dinan testified that the u.s department of energy would spend an additional 3.4 billion on financial support for energy technologies and energy efficiency broken down as follows energy efficiency and renewable energy 1.7 billion 51 percent nuclear energy 0.7 billion 22 percent fossil energy research development 0.5 billion 15 percent advanced research projects agency—energy 0.3 billion 8 percent electricity delivery and energy reliability 0.1 billion 4 percent 27 a 2011 study by the consulting firm management information services inc misi 28 estimated the total historical federal subsidies for various energy sources over the years 1950–2010 the study found that oil natural gas and coal received 369 billion 121 billion and 104 billion 2010 dollars respectively or 70 of total energy subsidies over that period oil natural gas and coal benefited most from percentage depletion allowances and other tax-based subsidies but oil also benefited heavily from regulatory subsidies such as exemptions from price controls and higher-than-average rates of return allowed on oil pipelines the misi report found that non-hydro renewable energy primarily wind and solar benefited from 74 billion in federal subsidies or 9 of the total largely in the form of tax policy and direct federal expenditures on research and development r d nuclear power benefited from 73 billion in federal subsidies 9 of the total largely in the form of r d while hydro power received 90 billion in federal subsidies 12 of the total a 2009 study by the environmental law institute 29 assessed the size and structure of u.s energy subsidies in 2002–08 the study estimated that subsidies to fossil fuel-based sources totaled about 72 billion over this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totaled 29 billion the study did not assess subsidies supporting nuclear energy the three largest fossil fuel subsidies were foreign tax credit 15.3 billion credit for production of non-conventional fuels 14.1 billion oil and gas exploration and development expensing 7.1 billion the three largest renewable fuel subsidies were alcohol credit for fuel excise tax 11.6 billion renewable electricity production credit 5.2 billion corn-based ethanol 5.0 billion in the united states the federal government has paid us 74 billion for energy subsidies to support r d for nuclear power 50 billion and fossil fuels 24 billion from 1973 to 2003 during this same timeframe renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency received a total of us 26 billion it has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help to level the playing field and support growing energy sectors namely solar power wind power and biofuels 30 however many of the subsidies available to the oil and gas industries are general business opportunity credits available to all us businesses particularly the foreign tax credit mentioned above the value of industry-specific oil gas and coal subsidies in 2006 was estimated by the texas state comptroller to be 6.25 billion about 60 of the amount calculated by the environmental law institute 31 the balance of federal subsides which the comptroller valued at 7.4 billion came from shared credits and deductions and oil defense spending on the strategic petroleum reserve energy infrastructure security etc critics allege that the most important subsidies to the nuclear industry have not involved cash payments but rather the shifting of construction costs and operating risks from investors to taxpayers and ratepayers burdening them with an array of risks including cost overruns defaults to accidents and nuclear waste management critics claim that this approach distorts market choices which they believe would otherwise favor less risky energy investments 32 many energy analysts such as clint wilder ron pernick and lester brown have suggested that energy subsidies need to be shifted away from mature and established industries and towards high growth clean energy they also suggest that such subsidies need to be reliable long-term and consistent to avoid the periodic difficulties that the wind industry has had in the united states 30 33 a 2012 study authored by researchers at the breakthrough institute brookings institution and world resources institute 34 estimated that between 2009 and 2014 the federal government will spend 150 billion on clean energy through a combination of direct spending and tax expenditures renewable electricity mainly wind solar geothermal hydro and tidal energy will account for the largest share of this expenditure 32.1 while spending on liquid biofuels will account for the next largest share 16.1 spending on multiple and other forms of clean energy including energy efficiency electric vehicles and advanced batteries high-speed rail grid and transportation electrification nuclear and advanced fossil fuel technologies will account for the remaining share 51.8 moreover the report finds that absent federal action spending on clean energy will decline by 75 from 44.3 billion in 2009 to 11.0 billion in 2014 united states government role in the development of new energy industries edit from civilian nuclear power to hydro wind solar and shale gas the united states federal government has played a central role in the development of new energy industries 35 america s nuclear power industry which currently supplies about 20 of the country s electricity has its origins in the manhattan project to develop atomic weapons during world war ii from 1942 to 1945 the united states invested 20 billion 2003 dollars into a massive nuclear research and deployment initiative but the achievement of the first nuclear weapon test in 1945 marked the beginning not the end of federal involvement in nuclear technologies president dwight d eisenhower s “ atoms for peace ” address in 1953 and the 1954 atomic energy act committed the united states to develop peaceful uses for nuclear technology including commercial energy generation the new national laboratory system established by the manhattan project was maintained and expanded and the government poured money into nuclear energy research and development 36 recognizing that research was not sufficient to spur the development of a nascent capital-intensive industry the federal government created financial incentives to spur the deployment of nuclear energy for example the 1957 price anderson act limited the liability of nuclear energy firms in case of serious accident and helped firms secure capital with federal loan guarantees in the favorable environment created by such incentives more than 100 nuclear plants were built in the united states by 1973 36 commercial wind power today one of the fastest growing energy sectors was also enabled through government support in the 1980s the federal government pursued two different r d efforts for wind turbine development the first was a “ big science ” effort by nasa and the department of energy doe to use u.s expertise in high-technology research and products to develop new large-scale wind turbines for electricity generation largely from scratch 37 a second more successful r d effort sponsored by the doe focused on component innovations for smaller turbines that used the operational experience of existing turbines to inform future research agendas joint research projects between the government and private firms produced a number of innovations that helped increase the efficiency of wind turbines including twisted blades and special-purpose airfoils publicly funded r d was coupled with efforts to build a domestic market for new turbines at the federal level this included tax credits and the passage of the public utilities regulatory policy act purpa which required that utilities purchase power from some small renewable energy generators at avoided cost 37 both federal and state support for wind turbine development helped drive costs down considerably but policy incentives at both the federal and state level were discontinued at the end of the decade 37 however after a nearly five-year federal policy hiatus in the late 1980s the u.s government enacted new policies to support the industry in the early 1990s the national renewable energy laboratory nrel continued its support for wind turbine r d and also launched the advanced wind turbine program awtp the goal of the awtp was to reduce the cost of wind power to rates that would be competitive in the u.s market policymakers also introduced new mechanisms to spur the demand of new wind turbines and boost the domestic market including a 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour tax credit adjusted over time for inflation included in the 1992 energy policy act today the wind industry s main subsidy support comes from the federal production tax credit the development of commercial solar power was also dependent on government support solar pv technology was born in the united states when daryl chapin calvin fuller and gerald pearson at bell labs first demonstrated the silicon solar photovoltaic cell in 1954 38 the first cells recorded efficiencies of four percent far lower than the 25 percent efficiencies typical of some silicon crystalline cells today with the cost out of reach for most applications developers of the new technology had to look elsewhere for an early market as it turned out solar pv did make economic sense in one market segment aerospace the united states army and air force viewed the technology as an ideal power source for a top-secret project on earth-orbiting satellites the government contracted with hoffman electronics to provide solar cells for its new space exploration program the first commercial satellite the vanguard i launched in 1958 was equipped with both silicon solar cells and chemical batteries 38 by 1965 nasa was using almost a million solar pv cells strong government demand and early research support for solar cells paid off in the form of dramatic declines in the cost of the technology and improvements in its performance from 1956 to 1973 the price of pv cells declined from 300 to 20 per watt 38 beginning in the 1970s as costs were declining manufacturers began producing solar pv cells for terrestrial applications solar pv found a new niche in areas distant from power lines where electricity was needed such as oil rigs and coast guard lighthouses the government continued to support the industry through the 1970s and early 1980s with new r d efforts under presidents richard nixon and gerald ford both republicans and president jimmy carter a democrat as a direct result of government involvement in solar pv development 13 of the 14 top innovations in pv over the past three decades were developed with the help of federal dollars nine of which were fully funded by the public sector 39 more recently than nuclear wind or solar the development of the shale gas industry and subsequent boom in shale gas development in the united states was enabled through government support 40 41 the history of shale gas fracking in the united states was punctuated by the successive developments of massive hydraulic fracturing mhf microseismic imaging horizontal drilling and other key innovations that when combined made the once unreachable energy resource technically recoverable along each stage of the innovation pipeline – from basic research to applied r d to cost-sharing on demonstration projects to tax policy support for deployment – public-private partnerships and federal investments helped push hydraulic fracturing in shale into full commercial competitiveness through a combination of federally funded geologic research beginning in the 1970s public-private collaboration on demonstration project and r d priorities and tax policy support for unconventional technologies the federal government played a key role in the development of shale gas in the united states investigations have uncovered the crucial role of the government in the development of other energy technologies and industries including aviation and jet engines synthetic fuels 35 advanced natural gas turbines 42 and advanced diesel internal combustion engines 43 venezuela edit in venezuela the subsidizing of fossil fuels has caused the creation of a huge black market criminal groups smuggle fuel over the border mainly to colombia this is due to the large profits that can be gained by this act as fuel is much more expensive in colombia than in venezuela despite the fact that this issue is already well known in venezuela and insecurity in the region continues to rise the state has not yet raised or eliminated these fossil fuel subsidies 44 45 46 47
