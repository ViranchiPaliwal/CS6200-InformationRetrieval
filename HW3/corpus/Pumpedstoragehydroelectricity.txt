hydroelectricity psh or pumped hydroelectric energy storage phes is a type of hydroelectric energy storage used by electric power systems for load balancing the method stores energy in the form of gravitational potential energy of water pumped from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation low-cost surplus off-peak electric power is typically used to run the pumps during periods of high electrical demand the stored water is released through turbines to produce electric power although the losses of the pumping process makes the plant a net consumer of energy overall the system increases revenue by selling more electricity during periods of peak demand when electricity prices are highest pumped-storage hydroelectricity allows energy from intermittent sources such as solar wind and other renewables or excess electricity from continuous base-load sources such as coal or nuclear to be saved for periods of higher demand 1 2 the reservoirs used with pumped storage are quite small when compared to conventional hydroelectric dams of similar power capacity and generating periods are often less than half a day pumped storage is the largest-capacity form of grid energy storage available and as of 2017 the doe global energy storage database reports that psh accounts for over 96 of all active tracked storage installations worldwide with a total installed nameplate capacity of over 168 gw 3 the round-trip energy efficiency of psh varies between 70 –80 4 5 6 7 with some sources claiming up to 87 8 the main disadvantage of phs is the specialist nature of the site required needing both geographical height and water availability suitable sites are therefore likely to be in hilly or mountainous regions and potentially in areas of outstanding natural beauty and therefore there are also social and ecological issues to overcome 9 overview edit power distribution over a day of a pumped-storage hydroelectricity facility green represents power consumed in pumping red is power generated at times of low electrical demand excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the upper reservoir when there is higher demand water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine generating electricity reversible turbine generator assemblies act as a combined pump and turbine generator unit usually a francis turbine design in open-loop systems pure pumped-storage plants store water in an upper reservoir with no natural inflows while pump-back plants utilize a combination of pumped storage and conventional hydroelectric plants with an upper reservoir that is replenished in part by natural inflows from a stream or river plants that do not use pumped-storage are referred to as conventional hydroelectric plants conventional hydroelectric plants that have significant storage capacity may be able to play a similar role in the electrical grid as pumped storage by deferring output until needed taking into account evaporation losses from the exposed water surface and conversion losses energy recovery of 70-80 or more can be regained 10 this technique is currently the most cost-effective means of storing large amounts of electrical energy but capital costs and the presence of appropriate geography are critical decision factors in selecting pumped-storage plant sites the relatively low energy density of pumped storage systems requires either large flows and or large differences in height between reservoirs the only way to store a significant amount of energy is by having a large body of water located relatively near but as high above as possible a second body of water in some places this occurs naturally in others one or both bodies of water were man-made projects in which both reservoirs are artificial and in which no natural inflows are involved with either reservoir are referred to as closed loop systems 11 these systems may be economical because they flatten out load variations on the power grid permitting thermal power stations such as coal-fired plants and nuclear power plants that provide base-load electricity to continue operating at peak efficiency while reducing the need for peaking power plants that use the same fuels as many base-load thermal plants gas and oil but have been designed for flexibility rather than maximal efficiency hence pumped storage systems are crucial when coordinating large groups of heterogeneous generators however capital costs for pumped-storage plants are relatively high the upper reservoir llyn stwlan and dam of the ffestiniog pumped storage scheme in north wales the lower power station has four water turbines which generate 360 mw of electricity within 60 seconds of the need arising along with energy management pumped storage systems help control electrical network frequency and provide reserve generation thermal plants are much less able to respond to sudden changes in electrical demand potentially causing frequency and voltage instability pumped storage plants like other hydroelectric plants can respond to load changes within seconds the most important use for pumped storage has traditionally been to balance baseload powerplants but may also be used to abate the fluctuating output of intermittent energy sources pumped storage provides a load at times of high electricity output and low electricity demand enabling additional system peak capacity in certain jurisdictions electricity prices may be close to zero or occasionally negative on occasions that there is more electrical generation available than there is load available to absorb it although at present this is rarely due to wind or solar power alone increased wind and solar generation will increase the likelihood of such occurrences it is particularly likely that pumped storage will become especially important as a balance for very large scale photovoltaic generation 12 increased long distance transmission capacity combined with significant amounts of energy storage will be a crucial part of regulating any large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable power sources 13 the high non-firm renewable electricity penetration in some regions supplies 40 of annual output but 60 may be reached before additional storage is necessary 14 15 16 history edit the first use of pumped storage was in the 1890s in italy and switzerland in the 1930s reversible hydroelectric turbines became available these turbines could operate as both turbine-generators and in reverse as electric motor driven pumps the latest in large-scale engineering technology are variable speed machines for greater efficiency these machines operate in synchronization with the network frequency when generating but operate asynchronously independent of the network frequency when pumping the first use of pumped-storage in the united states was in 1930 by the connecticut electric and power company using a large reservoir located near new milford connecticut pumping water from the housatonic river to the storage reservoir 230 feet above 17 worldwide use edit see also united states department of energy international energy storage database in 2009 world pumped storage generating capacity was 104 gw 18 while other sources claim 127 gw which comprises the vast majority of all types of utility grade electric storage 19 the eu had 38.3 gw net capacity 36.8 of world capacity out of a total of 140 gw of hydropower and representing 5 of total net electrical capacity in the eu japan had 25.5 gw net capacity 24.5 of world capacity 18 in 2010 the united states had 21.5 gw of pumped storage generating capacity 20.6 of world capacity 20 phs generated net -5.501 gwh of energy in 2010 in the us 21 because more energy is consumed in pumping than is generated nameplate pumped storage capacity had grown to 21.6 gw by 2014 with pumped storage comprising 97 of grid-scale energy storage in the us as of late 2014 there were 51 active project proposals with a total of 39 gw of new nameplate capacity across all stages of the ferc licensing process for new pumped storage hydroelectric plants in the us but no new plants were currently under construction in the us at the time 22 23 the five largest operational pumped-storage plants are listed below for a detailed list see list of pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations station country location

capacity in megawatt-hours mwh is a different intrinsic property and can not be derived from the above given figures pump-back hydroelectric dams edit conventional hydroelectric dams may also make use of pumped storage in a hybrid system that both generates power from water naturally flowing into the reservoir as well as storing water pumped back to the reservoir from below the dam the grand coulee dam in the us was expanded with a pump-back system in 1973 34 existing dams may be repowered with reversing turbines thereby extending the length of time the plant can operate at capacity optionally a pump back powerhouse such as the russell dam 1992 may be added to a dam for increased generating capacity making use of an existing dams upper reservoir and transmission system can expedite projects and reduce costs potential technologies edit seawater edit pumped storage plants can operate on seawater although there are additional challenges involved compared to operation with fresh water in 1999 the 30 mw yanbaru project in okinawa was the first demonstration of seawater pumped storage a 300 mw seawater-based project has recently been proposed on lanai hawaii and several seawater-based projects have been proposed in ireland and chile citation needed direct pumping edit a new concept is to use wind turbines or solar power to drive water pumps directly this could provide a more efficient process and usefully smooth out the variability of energy captured from the wind or sun 35 36 37 in northern chile the espejo de tarapacá project is a power project of valhalla that combines solar and hydroelectric resources the project takes advantage of the unique geographic characteristics of the atacama desert in order to build a 300 mw pumped storage hydroelectric plant that uses the pacific ocean as its lower reservoir and an existing natural concavity as its upper reservoir and a 600 mw-ac solar photovoltaic plant that is located in the region with the highest solar irradiation in the world the above characteristics minimize the environmental impact and the cost of the plant which is usd 400 mm for the pumped storage and usd 900 mm for the solar power plant underground reservoirs edit the use of underground reservoirs has been investigated recent examples include the proposed summit project in norton ohio the proposed maysville project in kentucky underground limestone mine and the mount hope project in new jersey which was to have used a former iron mine as the lower reservoir several new underground pumped storage projects have been proposed cost-per-kilowatt estimates for these projects can be lower than for surface projects if they use existing underground mine space there are limited opportunities involving suitable underground space but the number of underground pumped storage opportunities may increase if abandoned coal mines prove suitable decentralised systems edit small pumped-storage hydropower plants can be built on streams and within infrastructures such as drinking water networks 38 and artificial snow making infrastructures such plants provide distributed energy storage and distributed flexible electricity production and can contribute to the decentralized integration of intermittent renewable energy technologies such as wind power and solar power reservoirs that can be used for small pumped-storage hydropower plants could include 39 natural or artificial lakes reservoirs within other structures such as irrigation or unused portions of mines or underground military installations in switzerland one study suggested that the total installed capacity of small pumped-storage hydropower plants in 2011 could be increased by 3 to 9 times by providing adequate policy instruments 39
