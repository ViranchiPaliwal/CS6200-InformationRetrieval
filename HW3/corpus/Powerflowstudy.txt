power-flow study wikipedia power-flow study from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search in power engineering the power-flow study or load-flow study is a numerical analysis of the flow of electric power in an interconnected system a power-flow study usually uses simplified notations such as a one-line diagram and per-unit system and focuses on various aspects of ac power parameters such as voltages voltage angles real power and reactive power it analyzes the power systems in normal steady-state operation power-flow or load-flow studies are important for planning future expansion of power systems as well as in determining the best operation of existing systems the principal information obtained from the power-flow study is the magnitude and phase angle of the voltage at each bus and the real and reactive power flowing in each line commercial power systems are usually too complex to allow for hand solution of the power flow special purpose network analyzers were built between 1929 and the early 1960s to provide laboratory-scale physical models of power systems large-scale digital computers replaced the analog methods with numerical solutions in addition to a power-flow study computer programs perform related calculations such as short-circuit fault analysis stability studies transient and steady-state unit commitment and economic dispatch 1 in particular some programs use linear programming to find the optimal power flow the conditions which give the lowest cost per kilowatt hour delivered a load flow study is especially valuable for a system with multiple load centers such as a refinery complex the power flow study is an analysis of the systemâ€™s capability to adequately supply the connected load the total system losses as well as individual line losses also are tabulated transformer tap positions are selected to ensure the correct voltage at critical locations such as motor control centers performing a load flow study on an existing system provides insight and recommendations as to the system operation and optimization of control settings to obtain maximum capacity while minimizing the operating costs the results of such an analysis are in terms of active power reactive power magnitude and phase angle furthermore power-flow computations are crucial for optimal operations of groups of generating units the open energy modelling initiative promotes open source load-flow models and other types of energy system models
