Assignment 4:
Goal: Introduction to Lucene. Retrieval and scoring using BM25.

Language used:
Python 2.7.10 for task2
Java 8 for task1

How to run this program
TASK 1:
I worked on the Idea IDE where I added the lucene libraries through program structure
so my code won't work if you run it through command prompt. You will have to first include the .jar files and then run the program.

Also make sure that query_file.txt containing all the queries is present in the directory where the code resides. Because I have changed the lucene implementation in such a way that it reads a query_file.txt for query inputs.

Task 2:
to run the program, run the following command in command prompt:
python task2.py
