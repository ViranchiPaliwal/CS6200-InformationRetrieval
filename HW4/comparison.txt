So, even though there are two documents common among the top 5 search results for both the systems, we can see that there are certain skewed rankings. The scores between documents retirieved from both systems are also not as consistent as we have seen in case of Query 1. Looking at the comparison we come to know that it is better than Query 2 but not as good as Query 1.

For this query we can say that the top 5 results derived from BM25 and Lucene systems are very similar. Among all four queries, this query has the highest degree of overlap between the retrieved results for both the systems.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSION:
Lucene scoring uses a combination of the Vector Space Model (VSM) of Information Retrieval and the Boolean model to determine how relevant a given Document is to a User's query. In general, the idea behind the VSM is the more times a query term appears in a document relative to the number of times the term appears in all the documents in the collection, the more relevant that document is to the query.

In Lucene, number of hits determine the number of documents across the corpus which contain all the query terms. These documents are given priorities while ranking over the ones which doesnot contain all the query terms. Boolean model plays an important role in determining the number of hits. So, the queries for which the number of hits are fairly high like Query2 and Query3, boolean model plays a major role in determining the final rankings of the documents. On the other hand, for Query1 and Query4, the number of hits as per Lucene is less. Consequently, Boolean model plays a lesser signficant role in the final rankings leading to more overlap between the results generated by my implementation Of BM25 and Lucene. 

If there are more number of hits in BM25 algorithm then the overall score decreases as ni increases. If ni increases then it might happen that N - ni might be lesser than ni thus resulting log will be negative, decreasing the score. BM25 uses a probabilistic model to score the document relevance. Hence the result might be different on the type of the query input.
