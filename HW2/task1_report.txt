Task-1 statistical report:

G1 graph:
The total number of pages in the graph are = 1000
no. of source pages = 0
no. of sink pages = 10
Proportion of sink pages = 10 / 1000 = 0.01
Proportion of source pages = 0 / 1000 = 0

G2 graph:
The total number of pages in the graph are = 183811
no. of source pages = 14350
no. of sink pages = 66175
Proportion of sink pages = 66175 / 183811 = 0.3600164
Proportion of source pages = 14350 / 183811 = 0.07807
